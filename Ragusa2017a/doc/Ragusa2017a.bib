abstract = {Sand composition of arenite successions is sensitive to a suite of factors operating between initial grain production and final diagenesis on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Seven allogenic factors, the relative importance of which relies upon the complex interaction between tectonics, eustasy, and climate, play a decisive role in dictating petrofacies distribution within siliciclastic to hybrid depositional sequences. These factors include (i) tectonic exhumation, (ii) physical and chemical rock breakdown, (iii) change in sediment flux, (iv) change in source/basin physiography, (v) shelf colonization by organisms, (vi) generation of chemical grains, and (vii) volcanism. Autogenic processes may locally have a considerable influence on the type and amount of sediment supplied to the basin, thus interfering with the external control. Based upon literature data, a conceptual framework of expected compositional changes across the key surfaces for sequence-stratigraphic interpretation is outlined. Two case histories, from the Miocene shelf-to-turbidite deposits of the northern Apennines and the Quaternary alluvial-to-nearshore succession of the Adriatic coast, respectively, are used as references to illustrate how arenite petrofacies changes can be framed into a sequence-stratigraphic scheme on multiple timescales.},

Despite the dominant intrabasinal origin, bulk composition and heavy minerals of minor terrigenous mode indicate provenance from different crustal levels of the European and Adria plates. These data allow us to place the Helminthoid Flysch units within a Late Cretaceous paleogeographic reconstruction of the Northern Apennine Tethys. The depositional characters of these turbidites indicate the coexistence of an active tectonic setting, a paleogeographic location prone to carbonate ooze production and storage, and limited terrigenous sources outside the basin.},

abstract = {The Henares River, central Spain, flows westward from the Iberian Range (Mesozoic sedimentary rocks) under semi-arid climatic conditions. In the middle and lower reaches, the Henares River receives sediment from three tributaries (Ca{\~{n}}amares, Bornova and Sorbe rivers) that drain the Central System (Paleozoic crystalline rocks, low-grade metamorphic rocks, and minor amounts of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks). Modern sands from the Henares River and its tributaries offer an excellent opportunity to evaluate the importance of lithology and physiography in determining detrital modes from mixed metamorphic and sedimentary source terrain. Sand modes from the Henares River and its tributaries are quartzolithic. They plot in a restricted area on a QmFLt diagram, with low contents of feldspar and variable amounts of quartz, and carbonate, metamorphic and minor siliciclastic lithic fragments. Higher feldspar abundances in the Ca{\~{n}}amares and Bornova stream sands are related to the erosion of gneissic rocks. By contrast, sands from Sorbe River are low in feldspar, reflecting the absence of coarse metamorphic sources. Thus, proportions of bedrock lithologies in the drainage sub-basins are the main control on detrital modes of the tributaries. In addition, slope acts on the sand productivity of source rocks. Sedimentary source rocks in the upper reaches of the three tributaries have a poor productivity in the carbonate lithic fragments (Lsc), compared with the Lsc productivity of sedimentary sources located downstream, with higher relief. The percentage of bedrock types in the source area versus petrographic indices (Lm/L, Lss/L and Lsc/L) provide a useful contrast between source and sand composition in the tributaries. Thus, the high content of metamorphic lithic grains in the lithic grain population over-represents this lithology (slate plus schist) at the source terrain. Lithic grains from sedimentary clastic sources generate few recognizable grains (Lss) in the lithic grain population. Local supplies from carbonate sources may produce important increases of Lsc in short reaches of the channels. Sand compositions in the Henares River seem to be very homogeneous in a QmFLt diagram, with only minor differences caused by the supplies from the tributaries. These differences can be modeled in terms of end-member mixing processes between Henares detritus and detritus from the relevant tributary. These mixing processes are more evident when lithic grain contents (LmLvLs and LmLssLsc diagrams) are compared. Changes produced by inputs from the Ca{\~{n}}amares, Bornova and Sorbe rivers are not permanent along the Henares course. An important homogenization of Henares sand composition takes place by the mixing of tributary deposits with previously deposited Henares River terraces. Abrasion during transport does not appear to cause significant changes in the sand composition along the Henares River.},

New, robust analytical methods mitigate the effects of ubiquitous mineral inclusions, improving the precision and accuracy of garnet dates. Important differences between Sm–Nd and Lu–Hf with respect to partitioning, diffusivity, contaminant phases, and isotopic analysis make these two systems powerfully complementary.},

abstract = {Alpine provenance studies based on conventional methods such as sandstone framework grain and heavy mineral analyses are now enhanced by improved techniques in laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry detrital zircon analysis. Although the conventional methods appear to have reached their limits of resolution in palaeogeographic problems, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry U–Pb dating of detrital zircons adds the time dimension to the provenance analysis. Hafnium-isotope ratios measured on dated zircons give further information on the origin of the magmas in which the detrital zircons have grown. This study reports detrital zircon U–Pb dating and Hf-isotope results from sandstone formations related to rifting, drifting and subduction settings at different stages of the Alpine Tethys development. This study is a first evaluation of the correlation between U–Pb age and isotopic features of detrital zircons aimed at describing source terranes in different palaeogeographic domains in the Alpine Tethys area. Pan-African/Cadomian (Ediacaran–Ordovician), Variscan (Middle Devonian–Carboniferous) and Post-Variscan (Permian) detrital zircon populations are present in nearly all palaeogeographic settings, but in varying amounts. Single Mesoproterozoic and Palaeoproterozoic detrital zircons are found as minor populations. When comparing the northern and southern margins of the Alpine Tethys, the southern margin detrital sources are characterized mostly by a decreased occurrence or by the absence of Silurian–Devonian zircons. A major distinction between northern (Helvetic, North and Middle Penninic domains) and southern (Austro-Alpine and South Alpine domains) detrital sources is the occurrence of Triassic zircons at the southern Alpine Tethys margin during rifting and subduction stage sedimentation. Hafnium-isotope ratios measured on uppermost Permian–Triassic zircons from the South Alpine domain suggest a continental crust derivation of the hosting magmas, as expected in a continental rift environment. In the late stage of Alpine convergence (Late Cretaceous–Palaeogene), the Permian–Triassic zircons are reworked into basins situated on the northern Alpine Tethys margin.},

abstract = {The Lombardian Flysch of the Southern Alps records orogeny, uplift and erosion in the Austroalpine/South Alpine realm of the South Tethyan margin in Late Cretaceous times. The terrigenous flysch sediments overlay a deepening upward pelagic to hemipelagic sequence of Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age deposited on the submerged distal continental margin of the Apulian (Adria) promontory or microconlinent. Flysch sedimentation locally started in the Cenomanian but only became widespread from Early Turonian times onwards. After recession of the turbidite fans in the Campanian. hemipelagic and bioclastic slope sedimentation resumed in the latest Campanian to early Maastrichtian. Pebble and lithoclast analysis of the conglomerates and sandstones in the Lombardian Flysch show that the sedimentary and basement fragments came from a passive margin sequence with a facies development identical to that of the Lombardian Zone of the southern Alps or of the Austroalpine nappes. Bottom marks, pebble imbrication in organized conglomerates and channel orientation confirm a general provenance from the North to Northeast with a deflection of the currents into a westerly direction along the basin axis. Heavy mineral data indicate two major distinct source areas. During the early, Late Cenomanian to Turonian depositional history of the Lombardian basin, garnet and staurolite, accompanied by minor kyanite and sillimanite, indicate a main derivation of the material from (Variscan) amphibolite-grade metamorphic terranes (and overlying sediments) such as those exposed today in the Strona-Ceneri Zone of the southern Alps. During Coniacian to Early Santonian times, a different souice area must have been feeding the fan system represented by the Sarnico Sandstone and the Piano di Sirone Formation. As shown by the heavy mineral assemblage which is dominated by apatite, zircon, tourmaline and rutile, the crystalline source terranes were composed of low-grade metamorphics and granitic rocks. A more northeasterly source is suggested for these sediments by a similar heavy mineral assemblage in the Turonian flysch of Val Croina and in the Insubric Flysch, as well as by the Variscan metamorphic gradient in the Southern Alps diminishing towards the East. The heavy mineral assemblage of the Sarnico Sandstone and of the Piano di Sirone Formation corresponds to that of slightly older (Turonian) Austroalpine flysch formations in the Ortler Zone and in the Samaden zone/Bernina nappe which, however, also contain chromite from obducted or accreted ophiolites exposed still further to the North. The fan progradation of the Sarnico/Sirone system obviously reflects the peak of uplift along the Austroalpine/South Penninic convergence zone. In Late Santonian/Campanian times (Bergamo Flysch) the heavy minerals again point to a high-grade metamorphic source terrane.},

In the second one, with submarine lava flows, ages range between 120 and 70 My. At last, two ages of 285 and 303 My. have been obtained on diabases from the «Zone du Col de la Ramaz». The problem of metamorphism, spilitization and alteration of the dated rocks is discussed. The volcanic activity related to sea floor spreading phase before alpine orogeny appears to be of early Jurassic age while dated lava flows seem to be cretaceous. The diabasic lenses of the «Zone du Col de la Ramaz» should belong to the hercynian cycle.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained gabbros from two different localities in the Gets nappe (Upper Prealps) have been dated by U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar isotopic analyses. Zircons from bath gabbros gave identical concordant U-Pb ages of 166 ± 1 Ma (Fig. 4). Amphibole from one of them gave an 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 165.9 ± 2.2 Ma (Fig. 5). This concordance implies that 166± 1 Ma is the age of magmatic crystallization of these gabbros. The Gets wildflysch with its mafic and ultramafic lenses is an ophiolitic m{\'{e}}lange, that we infer to corne from a proximal part of the accretionary prism at the foot of the active SE margin of the Piemont ocean. In this position wecan expect to find remnants of the oldest parts of the Piemont oceanic crust. These are the tirst high-precision dates using modern techniques from an Alpine ophiolite and are in excellent agreement with the following: 1) The few, somewhat younger, reliable ages on ophiolites from the probable continuation of the Piemont basin into the Apennines and Corsica; 2) Recent data on the age of the first supra-ophiolitic sediments (Late Bathonian to Early Callovian radiolarites); 3) The structural and stratigraphie evolution of the Brian{\c{c}}onnais (s.s.) domain, the future NW margin of the Piemont ocean. We note a remarkable coincidence, in Late Bajocian time, between: (A) the end of tensile fracturing in the Brian{\c{c}}onnais continental crust; (B) the beginning of its subsidence; (C) the age of the Gets ophiolites. This coincidence is consistent with an ocean opening mechanism based on a combination of subhorizontal extension and thermally driven vertical movements of the lithosphere.},

abstract = {The Allalin gabbro is a 2 km x 0{\{}middle dot{\}}5 km block of layered olivine-gabbro and troctolite included in the Zermatt-Saas ophiolite nappe of the Western Alps. Comprehensive texture, mineral and rock composition data together with a thermodynamic analysis of the complex phase associations permit a detailed reconstruction of the igneous and metamorphic reaction history recorded by the gabbroic rocks. Based on rock and mineral composition data, the Allalin gabbro represents part of a Middle Jurassic underplate of mafic magma at the base of the continental crust of the Apulian plate (Dent Blanche-Sesia Lanzo system). Granulite-facies recrystallization during cooling at [{\~{}}]825{\{}degrees{\}}C and 1{\{}middle dot{\}}0 GPa, involving the formation of Opx-Grt coronas between Ol-Pl, can be related to crustal thickening. Eocene subduction of the Tethys oceanic lithosphere under the Apulian plate detached the gabbro from the base of the continental crust and incorporated it into the ophiolite. Increasing pressure in the descending slab had little effect on parts of the gabbro, which still locally contain unaltered igneous Ol, Aug and Pl and well-preserved magmatic textures. With increasing subduction depth an increasing amount of aqueous fluid accessed the gabbro and transformed Pl to Zo-Jd-Ky-Qtz. At about 2{\{}middle dot{\}}5 GPa (93 km) at c. 610{\{}degrees{\}}C, a dramatic hydration process converted most of the rocks ({\textgreater}90 vol. {\%}) into a fully hydrated eclogite-facies assemblage of Omp + Zo + Tlc + Cld {\{}+/-{\}} Grt {\{}+/-{\}} Ky + Rt. The full hydration under water-present conditions occurred at the greatest depth reached by the gabbro. After detachment from the downgoing slab (i.e. along the ascent path), Gln, Pg and Mrg formed as additional hydrates. This last phase of hydration desiccated the metagabbro at a depth of c. 78 km and from then on the rocks were essentially devoid of a free fluid phase. The Allalin gabbro provides strong evidence that the fundamental high-pressure transformation of mafic rocks involves the hydration of gabbro to form eclogite.},

abstract = {The palaeogeographic attribution of the Schlieren Flysch and its counterparts in the Gurnigel Nappe is still a matter of debate. These Late Alpine deep-sea trench deposits show a variable tectonic thrust relationship with other nappes inferring either an Ultrahelvetic or South Penninic origin of the elongated trench basin. An improved knowledge of the supplying source terranes of the Schlieren Flysch basin may add to the palaeogeographic ascription. Detrital zircons from seven representative samples have been dated by laser ablation ICP-MS analysis methods. The obtained age patterns are compared with standard provenance analysis methods including modal grain and heavy mineral statistics of the sandstones. The detrital zircons show two major populations of Pan-African (ca. 650–450 Ma) and Variscan (ca. 360–320 Ma) ages. A low abundance of Devonian detrital zircons separates the two main age populations. The Th/U signature of the zircons implies that igneous rocks of these two orogenic cycles directly, or indirectly (by multicyclic reworking of zircons) have strongly contributed to the clastic input. The earlier described bimodal turbiditic supply to the Schlieren Flysch basin is matched by the geochronologic data. With regard to the other petrographic signatures of the sandstones, it becomes evident that the granitic-rhyolitic source terrane derived (K-feldspar bearing) sandstones show a higher abundance of Pan-African zircons and a higher abundance of tourmaline in the heavy mineral fractions. In contrast, the exclusively plagioclase-bearing sandstones from the tonalitic–andesitic source contain a majority of Variscan zircons and higher contents of apatite. In addition, we observe a third minor population comprising Triassic–Early Jurassic detrital zircons. The correlation of the obtained detrital zircon ages with pre-Cretaceous igneous, metamorphic and geodynamic events, which affected the basement of the northern and southern margins of the Alpine Tethys reveals a major difference by the presence of Triassic magmatic products and volcaniclastics in South Alpine and Austroalpine units. The discovery of the minor Triassic–Early Jurassic population in both sandstone types of the Schlieren Flysch would argue for the derivation of the clastic material from the southern Alpine Tethys or Adriatic–Apulian margin.},

abstract = {The flysch sequences of the Swiss Prealps (Alpine front ranges) are described and interpreted in the light of a decade of study by a group research project at Fribourg. The geographical and geological settings are illustrated. The stratigraphy and sedimentology, the sedimentary petrography and the geodynamic setting are discussed. Correlations within and outside the Prealps, as well as outstanding problems, are treated. The flysch units and sequences covered are the Gurnigel Flysch, the M{\'{e}}dianes Flysch, Helminthoid Flysch, Fouyet, Manche and Mocausa Flysch, Hundsr{\"{u}}ck Flysch, Niesen Flysch and the Ultrahelvetic Flysch. The data from clast, framework-grain and heavy mineral analysis, from micropalaeontology, from facies analysis, palaeocurrent measurements and stratigraphy allow the interpretation of sedimentary environments, source terranes and depositional models. In all cases, flysch deposits are deep marine detrital accumulations and source areas were undergoing active tectonics. Individual models are based on the deep-sea fan concept, but interpretations tend to show significant modifications with respect to simple fan characteristics. These departures are to some extent due to available grain size, to active structuring of basins or to minor controls such as eustatic variations or climatic influence. The integration of sedimentological data with stratigraphy and regional structure furnishes palinspastic reconstructions in map view. These provide insights on the palaeogeography of the Western Alps from Mid-Cretaceous to Oligocene and give a picture of the evolution of the Western Mediterranean Tethys during the same period. The relationship between flysch deposition and alpine mountain building is confirmed, while constraints on basin evolution are established.},

abstract = {The Lower Carboniferous Culm Basin is part of the European Variscan foreland basin. Garnet is an abundant heavy mineral at all stratigraphic levels of the Culm sediments (the Protivanov, Rozstanı and Myslejovice Formation from base to top). This paper compares the major element (electron microprobe) and trace element (LA-ICP-MS) compositions of garnet for the purpose of studying the provenance of the Culm sediments. The polymict garnet assemblages ranging from the Protivanov to lower part of the Myslejovice Formation (Goniatite zones Peg-Goa) pass into oligomict ones dominated by pyrope–almandine garnets (uppermost part of the Myslejovice Formation; Goniatite zones Goh-Gog). As the predominant low-grossular pyrope-almandines from oligomict garnet assemblages are very uniform and homogeneous in major element composition, we studied their trace element composition and zoning. Pyrope–almandine garnets are poor in LREE and show enrichment in HREE; the chondrite-normalized patterns are almost flat from Dy to Lu and show a significant negative Euanomaly, typical for granulite-grade garnets. Major element compositions of detrital low-grossular pyrope–almandines can only be matched with some granulites and garnetiferous felsic gneisses of the Bohemian Massif. Garnets from granulites cropping out at the present-day erosion level of the Bohemian Massif have usually higher Ca and/or lower Mg contents. The major and trace element compositions and zoning patterns of pyrope–almandine garnets from the upper part of the Myslejovice Formation compare well with garnets from the Miroslav granulites and small Moldanubian granulite bodies west of the Trebıc Massif. The Moldanubian granulites are commonly associated with mantle-derived peridotites and eclogites. The presence of detrital Cr-spinels with high Cr{\#} and low Mg{\#} (single grains of Cr-spinels and fine-grained kelyphitic intergrowths of Cr-spinel with chlorite) comparable with spinel types from Moldanubian peridotites could indicate the joint occurrence of peridotites, serpentinized peridotites, and granulites at the erosion level of the Bohemian Massif during the deposition of the uppermost Culm sediments (325 Ma). While the older Culm sediments (polymict garnet assemblages) represent the accumulation of clastic material from the northern and north-western areas (Moravo-Silesian and Lugian Zone), the uppermost Culm sediments (oligomict garnet assemblages) contain material from western and south-western areas (Moldanubian Zone and Moravian Nappe); the general influx of clastic material changed as a result of clockwise rotation of the eastern part of the Variscan belt during this time span (340–325 Ma).},

abstract = {In the considered wide sector of the West-Mediterranean southern Europe, the collisional phase of the Variscan orogeny during Late Carboniferous and Permian times was followed by magmatic intrusive and effusive activity and sedimentation into intracontinental, alluvial to lacustrine basins originated by wrench- to normal-fault systems. The first volcanic cycle (generally Late Carboniferous-Early Permian in age) is represented by early calc-alkaline andesites and rhyolites, in variable amounts, and by following large volume of rhyolites, and by dacites. Both andesites and rhyolites show K-normal and high-K calc-alkaline character. The origin of the liquids of the first cycle is ascribed to partial melting processes at the mantle–crust interface telescoped within a thickened crust. The melting is considered as the consequence of thermal re-equilibration following isostatic disequilibrium and the subsequent collapse of the orogenic belt; the ascent of liquids occurred in a (trans-)tensional regime. The second magmatic cycle is represented by alkaline magmatism, and exhibits typical anorogenic features consistent with a rifting regime. This event was no more related with the collapse of the Variscan belt, but rather to the post-Variscan global re-organization of plates that evolved during Late Triassic times to the neo-Tethyan rifting. In both cycles, important differences in timing, areal distribution and outpoured volumes arise.},

abstract = {In the central Apennines, interacting siliciclastic and carbonate marine clastic wedges filled the foreland basin system during the late Miocene. Conjunction of collisional thrust tectonics and prethrusting normal faults generated a complex foredeep with intrabasinal structural highs that represented additional source areas to the basin. Detrital modes of the late Miocene central Apennines orogenic system range in composition from intrabasinal carbonate to quartzofeldspatholithic and calclithite arenites. The external zone of the foredeep is characterized by hemipelagic deposits, called the Orbulina Marl. Their arenite beds are composed by intrabasinal carbonate, with dominant bioclasts and minor intraclasts, and glauconite derived from an active shallow-marine carbonate source. These hemipelagic deposits are partly coeval with and partly overlain by siliciclastic turbidites of the Frosinone and the Argilloso-Arenacea Formations, and they represent deposition within local foredeep depocenters. Siliciclastic turbidite sandstones are quartzofeldspatholithic, which documents provenances from metamorphic, plutonic, ophiolitic, and sedimentary rocks. Carbonate intrabasinal structural highs were the main source for carbonate breccias, intrabasinal arenites, and calclithites of the Brecce della Renga Formation, the deposits of which are locally interbedded with the coeval siliciclastic turbidite sandstones. Evolution of late Miocene sandstone detrital modes reflected the changing nature of the central Apennines thrust belt through time and the complex architecture of the foreland basin system; it records the history of accretion, deformation of the foredeep, and progressive areal reduction of carbonate-producing areas along with the sedimentary and structural evolution of local intrabasinal highs.},

Petrofacies 2 hybrid arenites are characterized by significant amounts (‡10{\%}) of intrabasinal carbonate grains. Petrofacies 3 calcilithites contain relatively abundant (‡10{\%}) extrabasinal carbonate grains. On the basis of these petrofacies, a revised correlation of the sandy systems is proposed between the more proximal Ainsa basin, and the more distal Jaca basin sediments, now separated by the Boltan ̃a anticline, across which it is impossible to actually trace out individual beds or sandstone packages between both basins. The arenite composition in the Ainsa and Jaca basins is interpreted as being controlled mainly by synsedimentary tectonic processes that led to changes in sediment sources during basin evolution.},

abstract = {The Ligurian Alps are the southernmost segment of the Alpine orogenic belt. Their formation is the result of a multistage process that comprises two orogenic cycles: the Variscan and the Alpine one. Since the Late Paleozoic onwards, superposed sedimentary successions deposited in this area, as a response to the changing tectonic setting in the frame of the Western Mediterranean evolution. The transition between the two orogenies was characterized by the formation of a net of sedimentary basins controlled by diffused extension, which is not correlated to a clear geodynamic context yet. As the fault network is severely affected by Alpine reworking, the multiple pre-Alpine tectonic stages experienced by the Ligurian sector can be unravelled only by the analysis of the well exposed stratigraphic succession, which offers very distinctive feature for each tectonic phase. From the present day situation of a nappe-pile orogen backward to the originary basinal setting, the aim of this work is to reconstruct the paleogeographic evolution of the Ligurian Alps between Permian and Jurassic, through a detailed stratigraphic analysis. Several sedimentary packages belonging to different tectonic units are analysed, grouped into specific domains and correlated. Five major steps in the evolution of the Ligurian Alps have been pointed out; they have been contextualized within the latest paleogeographic reconstructions of the Alpine sector, contributing to detail the role of the study area in the plate tectonic dynamics. The sedimentary record is referred to successive geodynamic stages, from the Pangea break-up and Variscan belt dismantling, through a Triassic diffused extension, to the Alpine Tethys rifting and finally to the spread- ing that generated the Piedmont–Ligurian oceanic branch. The stratigraphic reconstruction of the Ligurian sector also indicates the lacking of an ocean interposed between the European continent and the Alpine collisional wedge, thus representing the southward termination of the Valais basin. On the whole, the paleogeographic reconstructions provided in this work highlight that the Ligurian Alps were a domain in which for over a hundred million years orogenesis, rifting and oceanisation strongly affect- ed the integrity of the upper crust. The heterogeneity of the crust that suffered multiple mantle uplifts, partial melting and extensive faulting over a long period is testified by field evidences and several effusive events. The last and most important rifting and the following Alpine Tethys oceanisation developed around a narrow, elongated area of crustal weakness generated by multiple geodynamic events.},

abstract = {Detrital modes of sandstone suites primarily reflect the different tectonic settings of provenance terranes, although various other sedimentological factors also influence sandstone compositions. Comparisons of sandstone compositions are aided by grouping diverse grain types into a few operational categories having broad genetic significance. Compositional fields associated with different provenances can then be displayed on standard triangular diagrams. The major provenance types related to continental sources are stable cratons, basement uplifts, magmatic arcs, and recycled orogens. Each provenance type contributes distinctive detritus preferentially to associated sedimentary basins that occupy a limited number of characteristic tectonic settings in each case. Sands of composite provenance can be described as mixtures of quartzose sand from stable cratons, quartzofeldspathic sand from basement uplifts or arc plutons, feldspatholithic sand from arc volcanics, and quartzolithic sands of several types from different kinds of recycled orogens that yield varying proportions of quartzose and lithic grains. Proportions of contributions from different provenance types can be estimated from mean compositions for ideal derivative sands represented by points or restricted areas on triangular plots. Evolutionary trends in sandstone composition within individual basins or sedimentary provinces commonly reflect changes in tectonic setting through time, or erosional modification of provenance terranes. Forearc sandstone suites typically evolve from feldspatholitic petrofacies of volcaniclastic nature, through lithofeldspathic petrofacies of volcanoplutonic origin, to quartzofeldspathic petrofacies of plutonic derivation. Foreland sandstone suites commonly evolve from rift-related quartzofeldspathic petrofacies, through quartzose petrofacies of passive continental margins, to quartzolithic petrofacies derived from recycled orogens.},

abstract = {The determination of detrital modes in graywackes and arkoses, here grouped as subquartzose sandstones, requires special attention to the identification of detrital grain types, as defined operationally, and to the recognition of detrital textures, as opposed to textural elements of diagenetic origin. Accurate detrital modes can yield specific information on provenance that can be gained in no other way. Reserving the terms graywacke and arkose for imprecise field descriptions and abandoning the proportion of matrix as a prime means of classification, subquartzose sandstones can be described adequately using six numerical grain parameters. Three primary parameters summing to 100 permit quantitative serial designation of rock types in the form Q x F y L z , where Q is total quartzose grains, F is total feldspar grains, and L is total unstable lithic fragments in the framework. Three secondary parameters in the form of ratios permit desirable refinement within each primary parameter: C/Q where C is total polycrystalline quartzose grains, P/F where P is total plagioclase grains, and V/L where V is total volcanic lithic grains. Stable grains, whose sum is the parameter Q, are essentially pure silica in mineralogy, and include both monacrystalline quartz and polycrystalline lithic fragments. The latter are gradational to less quartzose types and difficult to distinguish from felsite grains, which display relict textures of volcanic origin and internal relief owing to their polyminerallic nature. Lithic fragments are subdivided at two levels into four main categories within which are various subcategories: (a) volcanic fragments include felsitic, microlitic, lathwork, and vitric types; (b) clastic fragments include silty-sandy and argillaceous types; (c) tectonite fragments include metasedimentary quartzose types and metavolcanic feldspathic or ferromagnesian types; and (d) microgranular fragments include hypabyssal, hornfelsic, and indurated sedimentary types. Interstitial materials include (a) exotic cements like calcite or zeolite; (b) homogeneous, monominerallic phyllosilicate cement displaying textures indicative of porefilling; (c) clayey detrital lutum called protomatrix; (d) recrystallized lutum or protomatrix called orthomatrix with relict detrital texture (e) murky, polyminerallic, diagenetic pore-filling called epimatrix, whose growth is accompanied by alteration of framework grains; and (f) deformed and recrystallized lithic fragments called pseudomatrix. Extensive albitization and other alterations complicate the interpretation of detrital modes in many rocks, but potential errors commonly can be avoided by close attention to mineralogy and relict texture except where tectonite fabrics disrupt or transpose the original detrital framework. Most subquartzose sandstones were derived from one. or a mixture, of three salient provenance types: (a) volcanic terranes, yielding feldspatholithic rocks nearly free of quartz, (b) plutonic terranes, yielding feldspathic rocks with few lithic fragments, and (c) uplifted sedimentary and metasedimentary "tectonic" terranes, yielding "chert-grain" lithic rocks with few quartz and feldspar grains except where recycled volcanic or plutonic detritus is abundant. Many voluminous accumulations of subquartzose sandstones near continental margins had as their provenance complex volcano-plutonic orogens representing ancient magmatic arcs analogous to modern arcs associated with trenches.},

abstract = {The Great Valley Sequence of Upper Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous strata is composed of clastic detritus eroded from the Sierran-Klamath belt, which was the site of a late Mesozoic magmatic arc. The sequence accumulated mainly as a prismatic wedge of turbidites in an asymmetric trough within the arc-trench gap. Stratigraphic variations in detrital sandstone mineralogy define five petrologic intervals, or nearly synchronous petrofacies, useful for regional correlation. By contrast, local lithofacies are markedly lenticular. The clastic debris in the sequence was derived mainly from volcanic and plutonic rocks in varying proportions. The parameters used to define the petrofacies include: (a) content of quartzose grains (Q), feldspar grains (F), and unstable lithic fragments (L) expressed as volumetric percentages of the Q-F-L population; (b) ratios of plagioclase to total feldspar (P/F) and volcanic rock fragments to total unstable lithic fragments (V/L), and (c) content of mica (M) expressed as volumetric percentage of framework sand grains. The most distinctive characteristics of the petrofacies recognized, and their approximate time-stratigraphic spans, are as follows: (1) Stony Creek (Tithonian-Neocomian): quartz-poor and feldspatholithic sandstones with high P/F, high V/L, low M; (2) Lodoga (Aptian-Albian): quartz-rich sandstones with high P/F; (3) Boxer (Cenomanian): two distinct variants with moderate P/F, one quartz-rich and the other quartz-poor and feldspatholithic; (4) Cortina (Turonian-Coniacian): two similar variants with moderate P/F, one with Q-F-L proportions nearly equal and the other quartz-poor and feld-spatholithic; (5) Rumsey (Santonian-Campanian): quartz-rich lithofeldspathic with low P/F and high M. The nature of the petrofacies and their age can be related to the petrology and timing of dated intrusive episodes with inferred volcanic accompaniments in the Sierra Nevada. The Stony Creek petrofacies contains mainly volcanic debris erupted during the Yosemite magmatic epoch, and the overlying Lodoga petrofacies contains mainly plutonic debris emplaced during the same epoch, but only exposed to erosion by subsequent dissection. The Boxer and Cortina petrofacies contain mixed and intercalated volcanic and plutonic debris derived mainly from rocks erupted or emplaced during the Huntington Lake magmatic epoch. The slight differences between the Boxer and Cortina petrofacies may indicate that plutonic contributions were partly from older rocks for the Boxer, but volcanic contributions were essentially the same for both. The Rumsey facies contains mainly plutonic debris, with subordinate volcanic debris, derived from igneous rocks of the Cathedral Range magmatic epoch. Except locally or slightly, petrofacies boundaries do not transgress time-stratigraphic boundaries in the region. A close linkage among major magmatic, tectonic, and depositional events in arc-trench systems is implied.},

abstract = {Detrital framework modes of sandstone suites from different kinds of basins are a function of provenance types governed by plate tectonics. Quartzose sands from continental cratons are widespread within interior basins, platform successions, miogeoclinal wedges, and opening ocean basins. Arkosic sands from uplifted basement blocks are present locally in rift troughs and in wrench basins related to transform ruptures. Volcaniclastic lithic sands and more complex volcano-plutonic sands derived from magmatic arcs are present in trenches, forearc basins, and marginal seas. Recycled orogenic sands, rich in quartz or chert plus other lithic fragments and derived from subduction complexes, collision orogens, and foreland uplifts, are present in closing ocean basins, diverse succ ssor basins, and foreland basins. Triangular diagrams showing framework proportions of quartz, the two feldspars, polycrystalline quartzose lithics, and unstable lithics of volcanic and sedimentary parentage successfully distinguish the key provenance types. Relations between provenance and basin are important for hydrocarbon exploration because sand frameworks of contrasting detrital compositions respond differently to diagenesis, and thus display different trends of porosity reduction with depth of burial.},

abstract = {The 40 m thick Untersberg section (Salzburg, Austria) of the Northern Calcareous Alps comprises the Palaeocene–Eocene transition and spans the upper part of calcareous nannoplankton zone NP9 and the lower part of zone NP10 (sub-zone NP10a). These zones are equivalent to planktonic foraminifera zone P5 and the lower part of zone P6 (sub-zone P6a). The succession was deposited in a lower bathyal slope environment at a palaeodepth of about 2000 m. Within the dominantly marlstone succession, a 5.5-m-thick intercalation of red and green claystone and marly claystone represents the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) which is used to recognize the Palaeocene–Eocene boundary. The CIE was associated with a shallowing of the calcite compensation depth by at least 1 km. Throughout the section, clay mineral assemblages are dominated by smectite, indicating a seasonal climate with alternating wet and dry conditions. A 49{\%} increase in detrital quartz and feldspar within the CIE-interval suggests enhanced continental run-off. This was probably the result of the establishment of a monsoonal setting, in which vegetation was sparse, while periodic high rainfall caused pronounced sediment transport. The increased terrestrially derived input is associated with abundant radiolarian casts indicating high primary productivity. This suggests that seasonal nutrient pulses resulting from intensified precipitation during the wet season have caused high surface-water fertility. The benthic foraminifera faunas of the samples rich in siliceous plankton are strongly dominated by Glomospira spp., Nuttalides truempyii, Abyssamina poagi, Anomalinoides praeacutus, Anomalinoides nobilis, and Oridorsalis spp. We assume that the Glomospira–Nuttalides fauna consists of opportunistic species which quickly react to seasonally varying amounts of food. The calcareous nannoplankton assemblage of the CIE-interval is characterized by the first occurrences of the genus Rhomboaster and of Discoaster araneus and Discoaster mahmoudii, whereas Scapholithus apertus become extinct at the Palaeocene–Eocene boundary. Within nannoplankton sub-zone NP10a, a series of primarily basaltic ashes give evidence for a major episode of explosive volcanism which can be correlated with the positive ash-series of the Fur-Formation in northern Denmark. The wide dispersal distance of the tephras implies Plinian-scale eruptions and multiple ejections of large volumes of pyroclastic material.},

abstract = {The Aptian to Lower Cenomanian condensed phosphatic beds, deposited in the Helvetic Shelf along the northern Tethyan margin, consist of thin strata (generally {\textless}50 cm) of densely packed phosphatized particles and crudely laminated crusts embedded in glauconitic sands, marls, and pelagic micrites. The beds record very low net sediment-accumulation rates (typically 2–20 cm Ma−1). The presences of complex internal and laterally rapidly changing microstratigraphies, multiple phosphate generations, intimate mixtures of fossils from different biostratigraphical zones and ecological habitats, a proximal transition into bioturbated glauconitic sands, and a distal transition into allochthonous sediments deposited in channel and fan systems, indicate that the condensed phosphatic beds formed along the axis of a stable westward-flowing current system contouring the northern Tethyan margin. Repetitive cycles of deposition, phosphogenesis, re-exposure and reworking, and deposition (Baturin Cycles), caused by current-induced lateral migration of sand bodies, shaped the internal stratification and composition of the condensed phosphatic beds. Catastrophic burial of entire benthic communities was crucial to phosphogenesis. The sudden presence of large amounts of organic matter buried in siliciclasts created a reactive environment favourable for the concentration and precipitation of phosphates, probably with the help of physicochemical cycles of the Fe3+-Fe2+ and Mn4+-Mn2+ redox pairs.},

abstract = {Arenites contain several types of non-carbonate intrabasinal (NCI) grains which are seldom given specific attention in petrographic studies. However, recognition and analysis of these particles may be of invaluable help for stratigraphic, paleogeographic and even metamorphic reconstructions. Rip-up clasts are the most common NCI grains in various depositional environments. Concentration of other NCI types, such as green peloids, ferruginous ooids, reworked phosphates, chert, soil fragments, black pebbles or pyrite clasts, occurs at times of reduced sedimentation rates. During major transgressions, a wealth of iron, phosphorus, silica and organic matter of both terrestrial and marine origin is provided by rapid flooding of coastal plains, erosion of tropical soils developed during previous lowstand stages, and plankton blooms in nutrient-rich waters. Prolonged periods of starved detrital supply foster authigenesis and formation of sediments rich in iron, phosphorus and silica in shallow encroaching seas. Eventually, a variety of NCI grains from terrestrial, paralic and marine sources are reworked during stepwise coastal retreat and left as lags on ravinement surfaces or deposited in accreting sandwaves by storm or tidal currents. On passive margins, NCI-rich arenite intervals are typically found in the basal transgressive tract of depositional supersequences, when a rapid short-term eustatic rise is superimposed on regional thermo-tectonic subsidence associated with waning rift volcanism, break-up and reorganization of plate motion. Ironstone deposition is also favored by global "polytaxic" conditions and expanded oxygen-minimum layer in the oceans. Various types of NCI grains are also found in active margins and foreland basins, where they are generally diluted due to higher sedimentation rates. Other NCI grains, including plant debris, siliceous tests, clastic gypsum and even rarer particles may occur as framework components in arenites.},

abstract = {This contribution classifies detrital heavy mineral assemblages produced in contrasting geodynamic settings, following the provenance scheme proposed by Dickinson and co-workers in the late 1970s. The vital link with bulk-sediment detrital modes was established by systematically coupling high-resolution heavy mineral and petrographic analyses on the same sample sets, in a series of actualistic provenance studies carried out in key geological areas, characterised by arid to semiarid climate. Quartzofeldspathic to quartzose sands of “Continental Block Provenance” contain either heavy-mineral-rich, hornblende-dominated assemblages derived from amphibolite-facies basements exposed along rift escarpments and in cratonic shields, or heavy-mineral-poor suites with commonly rounded ultrastable grains recycled from cover strata. Volcanic rifted margins shed lithofeldspathic detritus with clinopyroxene-dominated suites (largely lilac-brown Ti-rich augite) that commonly include olivine. Abundant clinopyroxenes (mostly green augite) and hypersthene, associated with olivine or dark-brown to reddish-brown hornblende (oxyhornblende), characterise feldspatholithic sands of “Magmatic Arc Provenance”. The proportion of mainly blue-green hornblende increases progressively with erosion cutting deeper into the batholithic core of the arc massif. Quartzolithic sands of “Orogenic Provenance” include suites dominated by amphiboles, garnet, and epidote. The relative abundance of garnet (associated with subordinate staurolite, kyanite, and sillimanite) and blue-green to green-brown hornblende increases with increasing metamorphic grade of the sedimentary or igneous protoliths, respectively. Oman-type obduction orogens shed abundant heavy minerals, dominated by mafic and ultramafic minerals derived from the obducted ophiolite nappe. Apennine-type thin-skinned thrust belts provide heavy-mineral-poor assemblages recycled from accreted passive-margin successions or foredeep turbidites. Pyroxenes, derived from offscraped ophiolitic sequences, are locally present. The wealth of information heavy minerals provide on the geology of source areas makes their analysis an extremely powerful complementary tool in provenance studies of sediments not modified by diagenesis.},

abstract = {All tectonostratigraphic levels of the continental crust, from carbonate platforms in the Dolomites to granulites in the Ivrea Zone, are exposed along strike in the world‐famous Southern Alps cross section. In this extraordinary natural laboratory, we studied the composition of modern stream sands shed by each distinct type of source rock in order to improve on existing models of sediment provenance and specifically to reconstruct the step‐by‐step changes of detrital signatures ideally produced during unroofing of a continental block. Detritus from progressively deeper crustal levels of the Southern Alps changes systematically from lithic sedimentaclastic (unmetamorphosed cover sequences) to lithoquartzose, quartzolithic, and quartzofeldspathic metamorphiclastic (greenschist facies to amphibolite facies basement units) and finally to feldspathoquartzose and feldspathic composition (granulite facies basement units). Six progressively richer types of heavy mineral assemblages (ZTR‐brookite, garnet‐chloritoid, garnet‐staurolite, blue/green hornblende–kyanite, green/brown hornblende–fibrolitic sillimanite, and garnet–brown hornblende–prismatic sillimanite) faithfully reflect the increasing grade of metamorphic source rocks. Hypersthene–brown hornblende and olivine‐enstatite assemblages characterize detritus from lower crustal gabbros and mantle peridotites. In alpine settings undergoing rapid erosion and minor chemical weathering, the mineralogy of detrital sediments faithfully mirrors the mineralogy of their parent rocks. Therefore, our database can be used to integrate direct measurements of physical and chemical properties of exposed bedrock and to reconstruct an ideally complete mineralogy and density profile from the base to the top of the South Alpine crust. This shows a progressive upward increase in quartz and muscovite at the expense of plagioclase and heavy minerals and an effective density stratification from lower crustal (3.10–3.00 g/cm3) to middle crustal (∼2.85 g/cm3) and upper crustal levels (2.75–2.70 g/cm3). Sharp jumps in average rock density observed across major structural discontinuities (e.g., Cossato‐Mergozzo‐Brissago Line) mirror the fact that the South Alpine basement is the extensional stack of several slivers that followed distinct metamorphic and exhumation paths during the multistage tectonic evolution linking the Carboniferous Variscan Orogeny with the Jurassic opening of the Alpine Tethys.},

abstract = {By selecting a limited number of variables ( westward vs. eastward subduction polarity; oceanic vs. continental origin of downgoing and overriding plates), we identify eight end-member scenarios of plate convergence and orogeny. These are characterized by five different types of composite orogenic prisms uplifted above subduction zones to become sources of terrigenous sediments (Indo-Burman-type subduction complexes, Apennine-type thin-skinned orogens, Oman-type obduction orogens, Andean-type cordilleras, and Alpine-type collision orogens). Each type of composite orogen is envisaged here as the tectonic assembly of subparallel geological domains consisting of genetically associated rock complexes. Five types of such elongated orogenic domains are identified as the primary building blocks of composite orogens: magmatic arcs, obducted or accreted ophiolites, neometamorphic axial belts, accreted paleomargin remnants, and accreted orogenic clastic wedges. Detailed provenance studies on modern convergent-margin settings from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean show that erosion of each single orogenic domain produces peculiar detrital modes, heavy-mineral assemblages, and unroofing trends that can be predicted and modeled. Five corresponding primary types of sediment provenances ( magmatic arc, ophiolite, axial belt, continental block, and clastic wedge provenances) are thus identified, which reproduce, redefine, or integrate provenance types and variants originally recognized by W. R. Dickinson and C. A. Suczek in 1979. These five primary provenances may be variously recombined in order to describe the full complexities of mixed detrital signatures produced by erosion of different types of composite orogenic prisms. Our provenance model represents a flexible and valuable conceptual tool to predict the evolutionary trends of detrital modes and heavy-mineral assemblages produced by uplift and progressive erosional unroofing of various types of orogenic belts and to interpret petrofacies from arc-related, foreland-basin, foredeep, and remnant-ocean clastic wedges.},

abstract = {Collision orogens such as the Alps or the Himalayas are generated by plate convergence, culminating in attempted subduction of a thinned continental margin. Massive amounts of metamorphic rocks displaying high-pressure parageneses are produced during such relatively brief tectonic events and then rapidly exhumed to form the axial backbone of the new orogen. Sediment composition provides a fundamental key to identify past events of continental subduction,although coupled detrital-geochronology techniques are needed to discriminate neometamorphic and paleometa- morphic sources of detritus. Within the Austroalpine Cretaceous and Penninic Eocene axial belts of the Alps, we ideally distinguish three structural levels, each characterized by diagnostic detrital fingerprints. The shallow level chiefly consists of offscraped remnant-ocean turbidites and unmetamorphosed continental-margin sediments and mostly produces lithic to quartzolithic sedimentaclastic sands yielding very poor heavy mineral suites including ultrastable minerals. The intermediate level includes low-grade metasediments and polymetamorphic basements and sheds quartzolithic to feldspatholithoquartzose metamorphiclastic sands yielding moderately rich epidote-amphibole suites with chloritoid or garnet. The deep level contains eclogitic remnants of continent-ocean transitions and supplies feldspatholithoquartzose/feldspathoquartzose high-rank metamorphiclastic to lithic ultramaficlastic sands yielding rich to extremely rich suites dominated by garnet, hornblende, or epidote, depending on protoliths (continental vs.oceanic) and pressure/temperature paths during exhumation. Although widely overprinted under greenschist-facies or amphibolite-facies conditions, occurrence of ultradense eclogite in source areas is readily revealed by the heavy mineral concentration (HMC) index, which mirrors the average density of source rocks in the absence of hydraulic-sorting effects. Rather than the pressure peak reached at depth, the metamorphic index (MI) and hornblende color index (HCI) reflect peak temperatures reached at later stages, when subduction is throttled by arrival of thicker continental crust and geothermal gradients increase, as documented in detritus derived from the Tauern window and Lepontine Dome. Experience gained from modern sediments provides fundamental help to decrypt the information stored in the sedimentary record and thus to identify and reconstruct subduction events of the past.},

abstract = {An operational classification of metamorphic grains in sands and sandstones is proposed with the aim of enhancing data re- producibility among operators and the potential of high-resolution bulk petrography in provenance studies. For each of four protolith compositions (metapelite, metapsammite/metafelsite, metacarbonate, metabasite), six archetype grains displaying increasing degree of re- crystallization and foliation development are illustrated. Such a clas- sification grid is specifically devised as a subsidiary tool for point counting with the Gazzi–Dickinson method. Traditional QFR param- eters can also be easily recalculated from the data set obtained, thus meeting all possible needs (Decker and Helmold 1985; Suttner and Basu 1985). An experiment shows that usage of visual-comparison standards effectively minimizes operator variation and allows retrieval of crucial information during point counting in a reproducible way. A petrogenetic grid is presented as a subsidiary tool for classifying grains that include index minerals and to help correlation with dense-mineral data. The ‘‘metamorphic index'' (MI) is introduced as an estimator of average metamorphic grade of source rocks. Our classification, an ex- tension of concepts used first in the study of arc–continent collision in Taiwan (Dorsey 1988) and successfully expanded to interpret the evo- lution of continent–continent collision in the Himalayas (Najman and Garzanti 2000; White et al. 2002), proves to be fruitful in provenance analysis of foreland-basin sediments shed from Alpine-type, thick- skinned collision orogens, particularly when integrated with dense- mineral, geochemical, and geochronological data.},

abstract = {The Alps are perhaps the best studied thrust belt formed during continent-continent convergence (collision orogen). Shallow, intermediate, and deep structural levels can be distinguished within the Alpine thrust stack, each shedding sediments with distinct petrographic and mineralogical signatures. In modern first-cycle sands carried by Alpine rivers, bulk composition, rank of metamorphic lithic grains (metamorphic index [MI]), and dense mineral assemblages all faithfully mirror the tectono-metamorphic history of exposed basement and cover units. The shallow structural level, widely preserved in the Ligurian Alps, consists of remnant ocean turbidites, shedding sedimentary to very low rank metasedimentary detritus (MI ! 180). The few dense minerals include recycled ultrastables and garnet. The intermediate structural level, widely exposed in the Western Alps from the Simplon Fault to the Sestri-Voltaggio Zone, consists of high-pressure nappes retrogressed to greenschist facies. Detritus includes medium-rank metasedimentary lithic grains from cover units, quartz and feldspars from continental basements, or metabasite and foliated serpentine-schist lithic grains from subducted ophiolites. Dense minerals are epidote dominated and include high-pressure minerals (e.g., carpholite, Mg-chloritoid, glaucophane); Austroalpine and Penninic massifs supply abundant garnet. The deep structural level, unroofed in the Lepontine Dome, consists of amphibolite facies granitoid gneisses shedding very high rank quartzofeldspathic detritus ( MI 1 380 ). Dense minerals are hornblende dominated. The hornblende/epidote ratio increases, and the color of hornblende grains (hornblende-color index [HCI]) changes from dominantly blue green to green and green brown, from the periphery ( HCI ! 10) to the core (HCI 25–50) of the Lepontine Dome. Before reaching foreland basins on both sides of doubly vergent collision orogens, detritus from axial nappes mixes with detritus from basement and cover units uplifted in external thrust belts, and further modifications occur as a result of recycling of accreted molasse and alluvial plain deposits. This case study, which emphasizes both the complexities involved in provenance studies of foreland basin fills and their potential, provides detailed petrographic and mineralogical data on modern orogenic sands. Such actualistic information is the key for reconstructing paleotectonic and erosional evolution of orogenic source areas from detrital modes of ancient clastic wedges.},

abstract = {The Upper Prealpine nappe of the Swiss and French Prealps consists of a composite stack of various tectonic slivers (Gets, Simme, Dranse and Sarine sub-nappes, from top to bottom). The structural superposition and stratigraphic content of the individual sub-nappes suggests a successive stacking at the South Penninic/Adriatic transition zone during the Late Cretaceous and Early Paleogene. The present paper deals with two aspects. (1) new data obtained from the Complexe de base Series of the Dranse sub-nappe which underlies the Helminthoid Sandstone Formation, and (2) the development of a geodynamic accretionary model for the Upper Prealpine nappe stacking. The Complexe de base Series reveals a succession of black shales at the base, grading upward into variegated red/green and red shales which were deposited in an abyssal plain environment starved of clastic input. It is overlain by the Helminthoid Sandstone Formation. The combined analysis of planktic and agglutinated benthic foraminifera and comparisons with other Tethyan series suggest an Albian to Campanian age of the Complexe de base succession. Tectonic transport of the abyssal plain segment into a trench environment allowed for the stratigraphic superposition by the Helminthoid sandstone sequence. The present findings combine well with the general scheme of the Upper Prealpine nappe stack and several single results on parts of the nappe stack. We take that opportunity to present a comprehensive model for the tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Upper Prealpine nappe. We suggest that Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous asymmetric (?) extension at the South Penninic-Adriatic margin created an extensional alloehthon. Later during the mid-Cretaceous, the start of convergence drove the obduction of oceanic crust on the northern margin of the extensional allochthon. The resulting ophiolitic/continental source supplied clasts to the trench basin in front (Manche turbidite series), and the backarc basin (Mocausa Formation) and abyssal plain (Perri{\`{e}}res turbidite series) to the South. During Middle to Late Coniacian the main Adriatic margin was thrusted over the obductionrelated mixed belt and established an incipient accretionary prism containing the former trench, backarc and abyssal plain basin fill series. During this stage the Gueyraz (melange) Complex formed, which separates the trench series from the retroarc and abyssal plain formations. On top of the incipient accretionary prism a forearc basin developed hosting the Hundsr{\"{u}}ck Formation. The frontal abyssal plain formation (Complexe de base) still received few turbiditic intercalations. From Campanian time on, the forearc basin was bypassed and deposition of the Helminthoid Sandstone Formation occurred on the Complexe de base succession. During the Maastrichtian the abyssal plain and trench fill succession (Dranse nappe) was accreted to the incipient wedge, and in front of a newly active buttress, the Gurnigel trench basin was established. Another accretionary event during latest Paleocene/earliest Eocene added parts of that trench series to the base of the wedge (Sarine nappe). During the Late Eocene the accretionary wedge and remaining trench fill series (Gurnigel nappe) were thrusted en-bloc over the Middle Penninic limestone nappes and partly overtook the latter. Continued shortening of the resulting nappe pile and out-of-sequence thrusting accomplished the overriding of the Middle Penninic units over the former South Penninic Gurnigel trench series (inversion of palaeogeographic domains).},

abstract = {The Mont-Mort metapelites are one of the best preserved relies of the Variscan unit in the Brianconnais basement. These micaschists crystallized during a poly-phase metamorphic cycle, under amphibolite facies conditions. Mineral parageneses and geothermobarometric calculations indicate a two-stage evolution. Stage (1) (550-600 degrees C and 5-8 kbar) is documented by assemblages of zoned garnet, staurolite, kyanite(?), biotite, muscovite, quartz and pla gioclase. Stage (2) (550-600 degrees C and 2 kbar) is illustrated by assemblages of andalusite, sillimanite, muscovite, biotite. This metamorphic evolution is characterized by a nearly isothermal decompression path, terminating with the formation of andalusite-bearing veins. U-Pb monazite dates at 330 Ma and Ar-40/Ar-39 muscovite dates at 290-310 Ma (without substantial evidence of argon resetting) point to Variscan metamorphism and yield an estimate of the time interval between the thermal peak and the retrogression stage within this part of the Brianconnais basement. Restoring the Brianconnais and other Alpine basement units within an existing geodynamic model of Cordillera construction and destruction, it is possible to understand better the transition from a medium pressure/high temperature regime (collision with a peak metamorphism around 330 Ma) to low-P/high-T conditions (decompression in an extensional regime) with high geothermal gradient, as recorded by the successive Variscan parageneses within the Mont-Mort metapelites},

There are presently 32 approved species, with an additional 5 possible species needing further study to be approved. The general formula for the garnet supergroup minerals is {\{}X3{\}}[Y2](Z3)$\phi$12, where X, Y, and Z refer to dodecahedral, octahedral, and tetrahedral sites, respectively, and $\phi$ is O, OH, or F. Most garnets are cubic, space group Ia3d (no. 230), but two OH-bearing species (henritermierite and holtstamite) have tetragonal symmetry, space group, I41/acd (no. 142), and their X, Z, and $\phi$ sites are split into more symmetrically unique atomic positions. Total charge at the Z site and symmetry are criteria for distinguishing groups, whereas the dominant-constituent and dominant-valency rules are critical in identifying species. Twenty-nine species belong to one of five groups: the tetragonal henritermierite group and the isometric bitikleite, schorlomite, garnet, and berzeliite groups with a total charge at Z of 8 (silicate), 9 (oxide), 10 (silicate), 12 (silicate), and 15 (vanadate, arsenate), respectively. Three species are single representatives of potential groups in which Z is vacant or occupied by monovalent (halide, hydroxide) or divalent cations (oxide). We recommend that suffixes (other than Levinson modifiers) not be used in naming minerals in the garnet supergroup. Existing names with suffixes have been replaced with new root names where necessary: bitikleite-(SnAl) to bitikleite, bitikleite-(SnFe) to dzhuluite, bitikleite-(ZrFe) to usturite, and elbrusite-(Zr) to elbrusite. The name hibschite has been discredited in favor of grossular as Si is the dominant cation at the Z site. Twenty-one end-members have been reported as subordinate components in minerals of the garnet supergroup of which six have been reported in amounts up to 20 mol{\%} or more, and, thus, there is potential for more species to be discovered in the garnet supergroup. The nomenclature outlined in this report has been approved by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification of the International Mineralogical Association (Voting Proposal 11-D).},

Unlike previous models, which relate the fate of Alpine Tethys solely to relative motions of Africa, Iberia and Europe during opening of the Atlantic, our reconstruction additionally invokes independent microplates whose motions are constrained primarily by the geological record. The motions of these microplates (Adria, Iberia, Alcapia, Alkapecia, and Tiszia) relative to both Africa and Europe during Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic time involved the subduction of remnant Tethyan basins during the following three stages that are characterized by contrasting plate motions and driving forces: (1) 131–84 Ma intra-oceanic subduction of the Ligurian part of Alpine Tethys attached to Iberia coincided with Eo-alpine orogenesis in the Alcapia microplate, north of Africa. These events were triggered primarily by foundering of the older (170–131 Ma) Neotethyan subduction slab along the NE margin of the composite African–Adriatic plate; subduction was linked by a sinistral transform system to E–W opening of the Valais part of Alpine Tethys; (2) 84–35 Ma subduction of primarily the Piemont and Valais parts of Alpine Tethys which were then attached to the European plate beneath the overriding African and later Adriatic plates. NW translation of Adria with respect to Africa was accommodated primarily by slow widening of the Ionian Sea; (3) 35 Ma–Recent rollback subduction of the Ligurian part of Alpine Tethys coincided with Western Alpine orogenesis and involved the formation of the Gibraltar and Calabrian arcs. Rapid subduction and arc formation were driven primarily by the pull of the gravitationally unstable, retreating Adriatic and African slabs during slow convergence of Africa and Europe. The upper European–Iberian plate stretched to accommodate this slab retreat in a very mobile fashion, while the continental core of the Adriatic microplate acted as a rigid indenter within the Alpine collisional zone. The subducted lithosphere in this reconstruction can be correlated with slab material imaged by seismic tomography beneath the Alps and Apennines, as well as beneath parts of the Pannonian Basin, the Adriatic Sea, the Ligurian Sea, and the Western Mediterranean. The predicted amount of subducted lithosphere exceeds the estimated volume of slab material residing at depth by some 10–30{\%}, indicating that parts of slabs may be superposed within the mantle transition zone and/or that some of this subducted lithosphere became seismically transparent.},

abstract = {Tourmaline, a mineral often overlooked in petrologic studies, is shown to be a useful petrogenetic indicator mineral. Despite the large number of possible substitutions in tourmaline, generalizations relating tourmalinecompositionand rock type are made. Based on available literature data, distinct regions are defined within Al-Fe(tot)-Mg and Ca-Fe(tot)-Mg diagramsfor tourmaline from different rock types. As an example of the utility of tourmaline in petrologic studies,the accessory tourmaline from staurolite-gradepelitic schists from NW Maine is investigated. These tourmaline grainstypically display three general stylesof chemical zoning:(1) a lack of zoning,(2) a continuous core-to-rim zonation attributed to growth during progressive metamorphism, and (3) a zonation marked by a distinct discontinuity apparently representing detrital tourmaline grains surroundedby metamorphictourmaline overgrowths. All of the samples in this study contain si-, Al-, and Ti-saturating phases (quartz, staurolite,and ilmenite, respectively). Consequently, the substitutional complexities of tourmalinein equilibrium with the matrix are minimized. Systematic element partitioning suggests that chemical equilibrium has been attainedamongthe rims of the tourmalinegrains and matrix minerals. Tourmaline rims have the highest Mg/Fe and Na./Caratios of any of the phases in the metapelites. The compositions of tourmaline coresthat are presumed to be detrital in origin are optically and chemically distinct from their tourmaline overgrowths. In the Al-Fe(tot)-Mg and Ca-Fe(tot)-Mg diagrams, the compositionsof the detrital cores fall in the fields of rock types that are commonly found in the presumed source region for the pelitic sediments.},

abstract = {The Ultrahelvetic Flysch of the Swiss Prealps ranges from Late Cretaceous to Eocene in age. It occurs as isolated outcrops which are known by various local names—W{\"{a}}ggital Flysch in the Glarus Alps, Schlieren Flysch in central Switzerland, Leissigen Flysch in the Internal Prealps southwest of Lake Thun, and Gurnigel Flysch in the Bernese External Prealps. These Flysch formations are characterized by thick sequences of interbedded sandstone, conglomerate, shale, and silty limestone. The sandstone of the Flysch exhibits sedimentary structures typical of turbidity-current deposition—e.g., graded bedding, flute casts, groove casts. About 400 measurements of the directional sedimentary structures were made from the various Flysch formations. Paleocurrent information thus obtained was interpreted within the framework provided by the stratigraphic and tectonic studies of alpine geologists. The major conclusions of this paper are: (1) The Ultrahelvetic Flysch basins of the central Swiss Alps were created as a result of isostatic adjustment subsequent to an episode of pre-Maestrichtian folding. During the Maestrichtian to middle Eocene time, the Ultrahelvetic region was characterized by a topography typical of block-faulted terranes. Rugged land mass adjoining deep-sea basins resulted in conditions favorable for periodic turbidity-current deposition in those basins. (2) The Schlieren Flysch, the Leissigen Flysch, and the Sandstone Flysch near Adelboden were deposited in a row of near-shore deep-sea basins just south of a shallow shelf sea where carbonates of the Helvetic facies accumulated. These Flysch formations derived their sediments from the south or southwest. They were subsequently overthrust as the nappes of the Internal Prealps. (3) The W{\"{a}}ggital Flysch and the Gurnigel Flysch were deposited in a row},

abstract = {Arguments are presented to support the proposition that Ultrahelvetic Flysch basins were present on both sides of the Habkern island arc that was convex to the southeast during Paleocene time. The width of this Ultrahelvetic realm of sedimentation is estimated to have been at least 300 km in a northwest-southeast direction; this estimate is based upon comparison with the geometrical dimensions of modern basins and on paleoecological considerations. The deformational history of the Ultrahelvetic Flysch is interpreted in terms of plate tectonics. Two plates were involved, a Helvetic plate and a Penninic plate. The origin of the Flysch basins was related to the descent of the northward-moving Penninic plate under an island arc which was at the leading edge of the Helvetic plate. During late Eocene and early Oligocene, a plate flip took place and the Helvetic plate then descended below the Penninic plate. This reversal in plate relationships accounts for the occurrence of the discordant Bergell Pluton and concurrent andesitic volcanism, which supplied detritus to the North Helvetic Flysch.},

abstract = {The graded sandstones in the Prealpine flysch basins of late Cretaceous to middle Eocene age in Switzerland range in modal composition from arkoses to litharenites. The detritus is characterized by rock fragments from the crystalline basement and sedimentary cover (with volcanics), together with glauconite and shallow-water fossil fragments. Some of the flysch basins can be differentiated by the proportions of various rock fragments. The model for internal divisions in graded sandstones (Bouma, 1962) is modified to include small current ripples in the lower and upper divisions of horizontal lamination. The sandstone sole markings in the Basal Schlieren and Waggital sequences are parallel to within-bed currents measured in the lower division of horizontal lamination, current ripple division, and upper division of horizontal lamination. Within-bed current directions were measured using charcoal and parting-step lineations, small and large current ripples, and convolute lamination. There was no measurable effect due to the Coriolis force as the currents slowed down and deposited individual graded beds. Sandstone paleocurrents flowed soutwestward in the Basal Schlieren flysch and southward in the Waggital flysch. Ocean-bottom currents that oriented charcoal particles in interbedded green shales and micrite limestone flowed parallel, in each basin, to the currents from which the graded sandstones were deposited. Under an hypothesis of deposition of the graded sandstones from turbidity currents, the parallelism of ocean-bottom currents with sandstone sole markings could be fortuitous. However, one would expect that any postulated, down-slope, gravity-controlled turbidity currents would commonly flow in a direction different than ocean-bottom currents. Consequently an hypothesis that the graded sandstones were deposited from waning ocean-bottom currents is a distinct possibility. Furthermore, scatter diagrams among the textural variables of mean size, standard deviation, and skewness for the graded sandstones and siltstones are similar to scatter diagrams for sandstones and siltstones deposited by normal bottom currents in numerous continental and marine environments.},

abstract = {Actualistic models relating plate-tectonic setting to sedimentary basins and provenance successfully predict modal compositions of sand and sandstone at the scale of continents and ocean basins (third-order models). Second-order models may be used to identify source regions within a given tectonic setting, such as source terranes within the Rio Grande rift of New Mexico. First-order models relate the composition of modern alluvial sand directly to specific source rocks (e.g., granite). Petrographic data from locally derived sand of known provenance may be used to statistically discriminate compositions according to their source rocks, thus defining actualistic petrofacies. Ancient petrofacies may be compared to the actualistic petrofacies, in order to better constrain provenance and paleotectonic reconstructions. This approach may be applied at first-, second-, or third-order scales. At first- and second-order scales, stepwise discriminant analysis reveals the Tertiary provenance history of the Rio Grande rift of north-central New Mexico by comparing Tertiary petrofacies with modern petrofacies of known provenance. Application of this technique provides needed objectivity in source-rock and paleotectonic reconstructions.},

abstract = {Sandstone within the Late Cretaceous fore-arc basin of northern and central California displays vertical and horizontal compositional variations that facilitate stratigraphic correlation and reveal provenance characteristics. Four Sacramento Valley petrofacies, three San Joaquin petrofacies, and two late Late Cretaceous petrofacies that occur in both parts of the Great Valley are defined using the following six parameters: QFL{\%} quartz, QFL{\%} feldspar, QFL{\%} unstable lithics, framework{\%} phyllosilicates, plagioclase-to-total-feldspar ratio, and volcanic-to-total-unstable-lithics ratio. The scarcity of "significant" correlations between depositional facies and petrologic changes, the general "immature" nature of the sandstone, and the rapid rate of sedimentation suggest that provenance changes controlled sandstone composition and petrofacies sequence. The San Joaquin Valley petrofacies differ from the Sacramento Valley petrofacies by having higher framework phyllosilicate content, lower volcanic-to-total-unstable-lithics ratio, and more felsic volcanics. The intrusion of late Mesozoic plutons in the provenance area into primarily oceanic ("eugeosynclinal") crust to the north and primarily continental ("miogeosynclinal") crust to the south provides an explanation for these compositional differences. Plutonic sources increased at the expense of volcanic and metamorphic sources, and the potassium content of feldspar sources increased during the Late Cretaceous. By the late Late Cretaceous potassium-rich plutonic sources contributed detritus to all parts of the fore-arc basin. The sandstone compositions of these arc-derived sediments are clearly distinguishable from compositions of sediments derived from collision-generated orogenic terranes or from passive continental margins.},

abstract = {Empirical correlations between plate tectonic setting and sand/sandstone composition have been the basis for large scale petrological models. These models do not explicitly treat sampling scale. Four areas from the western USA with diverse tectonic settings and rock types provide a natural laboratory for sampling sand at three different scales: talus piles to small drainages (first order), streams and rivers draining mountain ranges (second order), and large rivers and marine environments (third order). Existing plate tectonic petrofacies models should only be applied to third order settings because the data were derived from studies of such settings. This is especially true in tectonic settings with diverse source rocks (e.g. continental rifts and transform settings). On the other hand, some settings, such as active magmatic arcs and foreland fold-thrust belts, provide uniform results at any sampling scale because of homogeneity of source rocks. The Rio Grande drainage area is especially complex, with diverse igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary source areas. Some components (e.g. basalt) are destroyed with minimal transport, whereas others (e.g. quartz) are relatively enriched with greater transport. In this complex continental rift setting, first and second order sand is diverse and heterogeneous due to input from tributaries. The Santa Clara River of southern California also has heterogeneous sand due to diverse source rocks in this transform setting. It is only after considerable homogenization and stabilization due to weathering and mixing with more stable components, and/or considerable transport, that homogeneous compositions are produced in these two settings. In contrast, the Cascade magmatic arc and the Canadian Rocky Mountain fold-thrust belt have uniform source rocks (dominantly volcanic in the former and dominantly sedimentary in the latter). Uniform sand composition that is unique to each of these tectonic settings results at any sampling scale in these two cases. Uniformity of data collection and analysis is essential for reproducible results. Use of the Gazzi-Dickinson point counting method allows direct comparison among source rocks (zero order samples), modern sand of any order and ancient sandstone of unknown provenance. Lack of recognition of the effect of sampling scale in the development of actualistic petrofacies models has led to incorrect rejection of many existing models. Third order sands are excellent predictors of plate tectonic setting, but first and second order sands can provide ambiguous plate tectonic interpretations in many settings. More complex actualistic petrofacies models based on diverse sampling scales are needed.},

Detailed point-counts of lithic grains, as well as standard QFL percentages, of 22 Neogene sand samples from DSDP sites 211 and 218 reveal very uniform compositions. Typical QFL percentages are: 55-30-15. Plagioclase/total feldspar is typically near 0.7. Lithic types are dominated by quartz-mica tectonite. quartz-mica aggregate, polycrystalline mica, and other sedimentary and metasedimentary varieties. Andesitic volcanic lithic grains are absent. The indicated provenance ("tectonic highlands") for Bengal-Nicobar sands contrasts markedly with that of sand and sandstone derived from magmatic arcs and rifted continental margins. Lithic populations of magmatic arc sand and sandstone are dominated by volcanic grains. whereas lithic populations of rifted continental margin sand and sandstone are dominated by polycrystalline quartz and sedimentary grains. Two triangular plots of lithic grains distinguish the provenance of sandstone derived from major tectonic settings.

abstract = {Thin mm to cm thick bentonite layers of Paleocene to Early Eocene age in the Tonsteinschichten of the Schlieren Flysch represent volcanic ash layers. Heavy mineral analysis of the layers indicates basic to acidic volcanic sources. U/Pb dating of single zircon crystals of a Paleocene layer (WW1948) by LA-ICP-MS points to an eruption at 59.87 ± 0.41 Ma, whereas ID-TIMS shows an eruption age of 60.96 ± 0.07 Ma. Taking into account the external precision of LA-ICP-MS analyses of 1–2{\%} both ages are overlapping and indicate an apparent minimal durations of zircon crystallization of 350 ka. Hf-isotope analysis of the same zircon crystals reveals the hybrid character of the source magma. The geochemical composition of the pumice grains of all bentonite layers is strongly affected by alteration. Nevertheless, the original character of the volcanic source can be evaluated. The Paleocene ashes (Lower Tonsteinschichten, LT) show a more fractionated multi-element pattern than the ashes of Early Eocene (Upper Tonsteinschichten, UT). The LT ash series are of rhyodacite to dacite character whereas the UT ashes fall in the field of alkali basalts. Both ash series seem to originate from a within-plate volcanic setting according to their trace element concentrations. Geochemical and temporary counterparts can be found in ash layers from Anthering (Austria) and the Danish Basin. As proposed for those ashes, volcanism connected to the opening of the North Atlantic might be the source as well for the ashes in the Schlieren Flysch. By comparison of the composition of rocks from the British Paleogene Igneous Province BPIP and the Schlieren Flysch ashes many correlations can be drawn which supports the suggestion of a North Atlantic origin of the Alpine ashes.},

abstract = {This work is an attempt to evaluate six different garnet discrimination diagrams (one binary diagram and five ternary diagrams) commonly used by many researchers. The mineral chemistry of detrital garnet is a useful tool in sedimentary provenance studies, yet there is no clear-cut understanding of what garnet type originates from which host lithology. Several discrimination diagrams exist for garnet showing distinct compositional fields, separated by strict boundaries that are thought to reflect specific types of source rocks. For this study, a large dataset was compiled (N = 3532) encompassing major element compositions of garnets derived from various host lithologies, including metamorphic, igneous, and mantle-derived rocks, in order to test the applicability of the various discrimination schemes. The dataset contains mineral chemical data collected from the literature complemented with some new data (N = 530) from garnet-bearing metamorphic and ultramafic rocks in Austria and Norway. Discrimination of the tested diagrams only works for a small group of garnets derived from mantle rocks, granulite-facies metasedimentary rocks, and felsic igneous rocks. For other garnet types, the assignment to a certain type of host rock remains ambiguous. This is considered insufficient and therefore the evaluated diagrams should be used with great care. We further apply compositional biplot analysis to derive some hints towards future perspectives in detrital garnet discrimination.},

abstract = {The present study deals with the Upper Cretaceous and Eocene formations exposed in the region south of Einsiedeln (Central Switzerland). These sediments belong to several tectonic units which, in this area, constitute the northern border of the Alpine chain: a) The «{\"{A}}ussere Einsiedler Schuppenzone» (Outer Imbricated Zone of Einsiedeln), consisting of displaced wedges of the youngest sediments from the Helvetic Drusberg Nappe: Amdener Schichten (Amden Beds), Nummulitenkalk (Nummulitic Limestone), Globigerinenmergel (Globigerina Marls) and Burgsandstein (a local term for a Flysch-type sandstone). b) The Wildflysch: widely dispersed heterogeneous rocks, usually imbricated above, between or below units a) and c). c) The W{\"{a}}gital-Flysch: a shale-siltstone-sandstone sequence of typical Flysch character. The micropaleontological investigation of the shaly-marly marine sediments was a major purpose of this study. The examination of the planktonic and benthonic smaller foraminifera as well as the calcareous nannoplankton has lead to a more precise age dating of some of the formations. The Amdener Schichten were found to be of Santonian age and to include the Zones of Globotruncana concavata concavata and G. concavata carinola. The Globigerinenmergel are dated as late Middle Eocene (Globorotalia cerroazulensis possagnoensis Zone to G. e. pomeroli/G. e. cerroazulensis Zone of Toumarkine and Bolli 1970). The Wildflysch has yielded Globorotalia cerroazulensis cocoaensis and Isthmolithus recurvus, indicators of a Late Eocene age. The W{\"{a}}gital-Flysch contains two distinct assemblages of foraminifera; one appears to be of Campanian to early Maastrichtian, the other of Middle Eocene age. In some samples, a mixture of these two faunas is found, others contain only non-calcareous agglutinated foraminifera. The present data do not confirm the interpretation of earlier authors that the W{\"{a}}gital-Flysch represents a continuous stratigraphie sequence from the Turonian to the Lower Eocene.},

abstract = {The Sardona Flysch of eastern Switzerland was deposited in the northern sector of the embryonic Alpine Foreland Basin, the so-called North Penninic Trough, during the Late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary. The flysch sediments consist of quartz arenites, sublitharenites and arkosic arenites, plus polygenic, pebble to boulder conglomerates. The Sardona Flysch was sourced by a single petrologic province composed of plutonic, Variscan granitoids, gneisses and low-grade, quartzo-feldspathic schists, plus associated cover sediments throughout its sedimentary history. Its heavy mineral suite principally comprises zircon, tourmaline, rutile and varying amounts of apatite, whose distribution cannot be used to characterise the various lithostratigraphic units. However, recording the diagnostic varieties of ultrastable heavy minerals using a `high-resolution heavy mineral analysis' (HRHMA) yielded conclusive results. The varietal distribution of zircon proved especially informative, demonstrating that changes in its distributional trends coincide remarkably well with lithostratigraphic subdivisions and reveal subtle variations in the provenance of the flysch. The limited number of heavy mineral species was predetermined by the low diversity of parent rock lithologies in the hinterland, rather than resulting from high sediment maturity, or progressive removal of unstable species during diagenesis. The basin was structurally confined by the South Helvetic and North Penninic Prattigau Swells, which defined its northern and southern margins, respectively; these structural highs may represent Mesozoic normal fault-blocks reactivated under compressive stresses within the European foreland. They provided detritus to the Sardona flysch basin and prevented the influx of material from the orogenic thrust wedge. Hence, garnet and unstable heavy minerals recycled from medium-grade metamorphic rocks within the mineralogically more diverse Austroalpine thrust wedge are absent from the flysch sediments.},

abstract = {Routine use of QFL, QpLsmLvm, and LmLsLv plate-tectonic provenance diagrams has led to the recognition of error populations. For these sandstones, the interpretation of tectonic setting based on data exclusive of petrography does not coincide with the interpretation of tectonic setting based on their location on compositional diagrams. The anomalous sandstones can be separated into at least four categories: i) sandstones deposited during the transition between tectonic regimes may be derived, in part, from relict source rocks; ii) the relative enrichment of sandstones in detrital quartz by weathering and/or depositional reworking may lead to an inaccurate interpretation of tectonic setting from compositional data; iii) sandstones deposited in tectonic settings as yet unrepresented on the provenance diagrams may plot between the provenance fields or overlap existing fields; iv) the role of detrital carbonate rock fragments directly affects the location of data points on provenance diagrams, and is an unresolved problem. The first two categories represent permanent problems in the use of sandstone composition as an indicator of plate-tectonic setting, whereas the last two may only be temporary problems that can be solved by more data and a consensus on determining detrital modes. Recognition of anomalous sandstones in the rock record will reduce the probability of erroneous interpretations of tectonic setting and enhance the use of sandstone petrology as an indicator of plate-tectonic setting.},

abstract = {This contribution provides an insight into the use of mineral chemistry in provenance research, and demonstrates how studies, by using microbeam techniques on several detrital heavy mineral species, benefit from continuing technological advances. Virtually all detrital heavy minerals can now be subjected to sophisticated geoanalytical techniques that can determine their major and trace element compositions and identify their crystal chemistry. Petrogenetic controls impart distinctive elemental signatures to mineral phases in igneous and metamorphic rocks that are preserved in mineral grains eroded from them, and can be used as a genetic tool to help decode their parageneses. Of particular interest are those heavy minerals that are widespread in sediments with compositions that are suitable for routine geochemical analysis. In this review, the geochemistry of garnet, tourmaline, chrome spinel, apatite, pyroxenes and amphiboles and its application to specific geological problems is discussed in detail; brief references are given to minerals that have not been used frequently in provenance studies. It is important to emphasise that a particular species, chosen for geochemistry, is generally associated with other minerals that are also carriers of information. Therefore, mineral chemical data need to be integrated with information from the whole assemblage to ensure that the conclusions are truly comprehensive. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study reviews and synthesizes the present knowledge on the Sesia–Dent Blanche nappes, the highest tectonic elements in the Western Alps (Switzerland and Italy), which comprise pieces of pre-Alpine basement and Mesozoic cover. All of the available data are integrated in a crustal-scale kinematic model with the aim to reconstruct the Alpine tectono-metamorphic evolution of the Sesia–Dent Blanche nappes. Although major uncertainties remain in the pre-Alpine geometry, the basement and cover sequences of the Sesia–Dent Blanche nappes are seen as part of a thinned continental crust derived from the Adriatic margin. The earliest stages of the Alpine evolution are interpreted as recording late Cretaceous subduction of the Adria-derived Sesia–Dent Blanche nappes below the South-Alpine domain. During this subduction, several sheets of crustal material were stacked and separated by shear zones that rework remnants of their Mesozoic cover. The recently described Roisan-Cignana Shear Zone of the Dent Blanche Tectonic System represents such a shear zone, indicating that the Sesia–Dent Blanche nappes represent a stack of several individual nappes. During the subsequent subduction of the Piemonte–Liguria Ocean large-scale folding of the nappe stack (including the Roisan-Cignana Shear Zone) took place under greenschist facies conditions, which indicates partial exhumation of the Dent Blanche Tectonic System. The entrance of the Brian{\c{c}}onnais micro-continent within the subduction zone led to a drastic change in the deformation pattern of the Alpine belt, with rapid exhumation of the eclogite-facies ophiolite-bearing units and thrust propagation towards the foreland. Slab breakoff probably was responsible for allowing partial melting in the mantle and Oligocene intrusions into the most internal parts of the Sesia–Dent Blanche nappes. Finally, indentation of the Adriatic plate into the orogenic wedge resulted in the formation of the Vanzone back-fold, which marks the end of the pervasive ductile deformation within the Sesia–Dent Blanche nappes during the earliest Miocene.},

Calcite (CaCO 3 {\textgreater} 99 mole {\%}) and kaolinite were formed as by-products of plagioclase albitization. Sodium-rich detrital plagioclase (An 2 -An 11 ) are usually unalbitized. Detrital K-feldspar is fresh or, rarely, partly albitized. Differences in albitization behavior of detrital plagioclase and K-feldspar are shown to be related to the chemistry of formation waters, reactivity of kaolinite, and temperature. The diagenetically formed albite pseudomorphs are very pure (Ab {\textgreater} 99), well-ordered low-albite, dark-luminescent, vacuolized, mostly untwinned, and comprised of numerous euhedral albite crystals. Some of the microporosity within the albite pseudomorphs is caused by volume reduction during albitization of the detrital plagioclase. The amount of albite formed in the pseudomorphs is related to the molar proportion of albite component in the detrital unstable Ca-rich plagioclase. The microporosity formed during albitization is proportional to the anorthite component, which is believed to have dissolved and resulted primarily in the formation of calcite and kaolinite. The albitization of detrital plagioclase in the studied sandstones can thus be explained without assuming the consumption of significant amounts of Na (super +) from pore solutions.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal distribution of diagenetic alterations in siliciclastic sequences is controlled by a complex array of interrelated parameters that prevail during eodiagenesis, mesodiagenesis and telodiagenesis. The spatial distribution of near-surface eogenetic alteration is controlled by depositional facies, climate, detrital composition and relative changes in sea-level. The most important eogenetic alterations in continental sediments include silicate dissolution and the formation of kaolinite, smectite, calcrete and dolocrete. In marine and transitional sediments, eogenetic alterations include the precipitation of carbonate, opal, microquartz, Fe-silicates (glaucony, berthierine and nontronite), sulphides and zeolite. The eogenetic evolution of marine and transitional sediments can probably be developed within a predictable sequence stratigraphic context. Mesodiagenesis is strongly influenced by the induced eogenetic alterations, as well as by temperature, pressure and the composition of basinal brines. The residence time of sedimentary sequences under certain burial conditions is of key importance in determining the timing, extent and patterns of diagenetic modifications induced. The most important mesogenetic alterations include feldspar albitization, illitization and chloritization of smectite and kaolinite, dickitization of kaolinite, chemical compaction as well as quartz and carbonate cementation. Various aspects of deep-burial mesodiagenesis are still poorly understood, such as: (i) whether reactions are accomplished by active fluid flow or by diffusion; (ii) the pattern and extent of mass transfer between mudrocks and sandstones; (iii) the role of hydrocarbon emplacement on sandstone diagenesis; and (iv) the importance and origin of fluids involved in the formation of secondary inter- and intragranular porosity during mesodiagenesis. Uplift and incursion of meteoric waters induce telogenetic alterations that include kaolinitization and carbonate-cement dissolution down to depths of tens to a few hundred metres below the surface.},

abstract = {The composition of heavy mineral assemblages in sandstones may be heavily influenced by processes operating during transport, deposition and diagenesis. As a consequence, conventional heavy mineral data may not be a reliable guide to the nature of sediment source material. Certain features of heavy mineral suites, however, are inherited directly from the source area without significant modification, such as the varietal characteristics of individual mineral species. This paper describes an alternative approach to varietal studies that concentrates on relative abundances of minerals that are stable during diagenesis and have similar hydraulic behaviour. Ratios of apatite to tourmaline, TiO2 minerals to zircon, monazite to zircon, and chrome spinel to zircon provide a good reflection of the source rock characteristics, because they are comparatively immune to alteration during the sedimentary cycle. These ratios are described as index values (ATi, RZi, MZi and CZi, respectively). This approach avoids some of the practical problems associated with varietal studies, such as the need to make subjective decisions about mineral properties or to use advanced analytical techniques that may not be accessible to the analyst. It also makes use of more components of the heavy mineral suite and thus provides a more balanced view of provenance characteristics. The use of these ratios is illustrated with examples from Upper Jurassic sandstones in the Outer Moray Firth area of the UK continental shelf and Triassic sandstones from onshore and offshore UK. Heavy mineral indices, notably ATi and MZi, show marked variations in Upper Jurassic Piper sandstones of the Outer Moray Firth. Main Piper sandstones have lower ATi and MZi values compared with Supra Piper sandstones, indicating significant stratigraphic evolution of provenance. The UK Triassic shows major regional variations in a number of index values, including ATi, MZi and CZi, demonstrating that sediment was supplied from several distinct source regions. This indicates a need for some modification of existing palaeogeographic models for the UK Triassic.},

abstract = {Sandstone compositions result from a complex interplay between provenance and factors that operate during the sedimentation cycle. Accurate identification and discrimination of provenance depends on isolating provenance-sensitive features, and avoiding parameters that are influenced by other factors. Heavy mineral analysis offers a high-resolution approach to determination of sandstone provenance, because of the diversity of mineral species found in sandstones and because the factors affecting assemblages have been comprehensively evaluated. This paper presents the current understanding of the effects of processes operative during the sedimentation cycle. The original provenance signal may be overprinted by weathering at source prior to incorporation in the transport system; by mechanical breakdown during transport; by weathering during periods of alluvial storage on the floodplain; by hydraulic processes during transport and final deposition; by diagenesis during deep burial; and by weathering at outcrop. The most influential of these processes are hydraulics, which fractionates the relative abundance of minerals with different hydraulic behaviour, and burial diagenesis, which reduces mineral diversity through progressive dissolution of unstable mineral species. There is also evidence that weathering during alluvial storage plays a significant role. Two alternative, complementary approaches are recommended to identify provenance from heavy mineral data. The relative abundances of minerals with similar hydraulic and diagenetic behaviour are largely unaffected by processes operative during the sedimentation cycle, and utilize information gained from the entire heavy mineral suite. Determination of such ratios can be augmented by acquisition of varietal data, concentrating on the varieties shown by mineral types within the assemblage. A number of different varietal techniques are recommended, including optical differentiation of types based on colour, habit and internal structure, single-grain geochemical analysis, and single-grain geochronology.},

abstract = {The glauconitic facies is widespread on present-day continental shelves from 50° S to 65° N and at water depths between 50 and 500 m, and is in particularly great abundance on the upper slope and outer shelf between 200 and 300 m. It is also common in many ancient rocks of post-late Precambrian age. It occurs as sand- to pebble-sized, essentially green particles (granular facies) but also as a surface coating on particles and hardgrounds and as a diffuse impregnation (film and diffuse facies). We suggest the replacement of the term ‘glauconite', which has been interchangeably used to designate a morphological form and a specific mineral, by glaucony (facies) and glauconitic smectite and glauconitic mica as end members of the glauconitic mineral family. The widely accepted model of Burst and Hower for glauconitization requires a degraded, micaceous (2: 1 layer lattice structure) parent clay mineral. However, detailed analysis of numerous samples of Recent glaucony reveals that such a parent substrate is exceptional. The model therefore requires modification. Generally the parent material is carbonate particles, argillaceous (kaolinitic) faecal pellets, infillings of foraminiferal tests, various mineral grains and rock fragments, that pass gradually into the commonly occurring green grains. We show that the process of glauconitization is achieved by de novo authigenic growth of automorphous crystallites in the pores of the substrate, accompanied by progressive alteration and replacement of the substrate. It is this two-fold evolution that causes the ‘verdissement'of granular substrates, macrofossils and hardgrounds. The authigenic mineral is an iron-rich and potassium-poor glauconitic smectite. While new smectites are growing into the remaining pore space the earlier smectites are modified by incorporation of potassium, producing decreasingly expandable minerals with a non-expandable glauconitic mica as the end member. This mineralogical diversity of the glauconitic mineral family explains the highly variable physical and chemical properties of glaucony. Four categories, nascent, little-evolved, evolved and highly-evolved glaucony are distinguished. Glauconitization appears to be controlled by a delicate balance between degree of physical confinement of a particle and the amount of ionic exchange between the micro-environment and ambient open marine sea water. The optimum conditions for glauconitization are those of semi-confinement. As a result the interior of a grain is more glauconitized than its less confined periphery. Similarly, for identical substrate types, large grains (500$\mu$m) provide more favourable substrates for glauconitization than lesser confined small grains. On a larger scale the formation of glaucony is governed by the availability of iron and potassium and the balance between detrital influx and winnowing. Low accumulation rates expose grains to the open marine environment for sufficiently long times (105-106 years for highly-evolved glaucony).},

abstract = {New biostratigraphic, sedimentological and petrographic data and a thorough review of existing literature modify existing knowledge on the age, the sedimentology, the petrography and the palaeogeographic origin of the Gurnigel flysch from the Voirons massif (Haute Savoie, France). Planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy assigns the flysch to the upper Middle Eocene (zones P12 to P14) through to Lower Oligocene (zones P16 to P20) stages. This result contrasts with previous work, which assigned the unit to the Lower Palaeocene to upper Middle Eocene on the basis of calcareous nannofossil and dinoflagellate assemblages. The following findings suggest that the Voirons massif comprises several stacked flysch units that do not have exactly the same palaeogeographic origin: (i) the occurrence of flysch exposures in reverse stratigraphic order combined with the lack of evidence for bed overturning; (ii) the variability of palaeo-depositional settings inferred from different flysch outcrops of similar age; (iii) the differences in the heavy mineral content; and (iv) the anomalous superimposition of distal turbidites and/or basinal contourites (Saxel Marls) over proximal turbidites (Vouan Conglomerates). The young age of these kilometre-sized flysch slices precludes their hitherto postulated locus of deposition in the South-Penninic Ocean, and rather indicates a provenance from the Ultrahelvetic and/or North-Penninic (Valais) palaeogeographical domains. Finally, none of the nannofossil assemblages are contemporaneous with the observed planktonic foraminifera associations, suggesting that they have been reworked, dissolved, or just simply diluted and not found by earlier researchers. This study from the Voirons massif shows that planktonic foraminifera associations are a highly reliable biostratigraphic tool for obtaining accurate ages of flysch successions.},

abstract = {We studied two short, high-gradient river systems draining the Dolomite Alps in northeastern Italy in order to determine which grain types survive transport and to what extent sand grain types reflect source rocks. Grains of all the labile rock types in the source areas survived to lower reaches of the rivers. In one drainage (Boite-Piave), they reached the Adriatic coast. Carbonate grains (largely dolomite) in the Gadera-Rienza Rivers decreased abruptly, largely by dilution, from {\textgreater}50{\%} to trace amounts in 100 km of travel. Percentage of carbonate grains in the lower reaches of these rivers was generally less than one-half the areal percentage of limestone and dolostone exposure in the source areas. However, in the Boite-Piave Rivers (200 km long), enrichment of carbonate grains in beach sand at the expense of polycrystalline quartz and volcanic rock fragments results in dolostone sand at the beach reflecting 78{\%} of its outcrop abundance and limestone (calcite) sand reflecting 68{\%} of its outcrop abundance. Polycrystalline quartz and mafic volcanic rock fragments are less abundant in the beach because of dilution by longshore drift or the breakdown of these grains by wave abrasion. The relative resistance of carbonate textural grain types to abrasion is micrite {\textgreater} spar {\textgreater} mixed micrite/spar. The results indicate that detritus from dominantly silicic and intermediate volcanic rocks can survive fluvial transport and at least moderate wave abrasion. Metamorphic rock fragments (mostly phyllite) in the Gadera-Rienza Rivers survived transport to the confluence with the Isarco River at Bressanone. In the Boite-Piave river system, metamorphic rock fragments survived fluvial transport to the beach plus some beach abrasion. They did so because the relatively rapid transport down the high-gradient, low-sinuosity streams did not permit extensive chemical weathering. Grains of calcite (micrite and spar), dolomite, and volcanic rock fragments increased in roundness by abrasion in the surf after undergoing only a few kilometers of transport along the coast.},

Based on geobarometrically useful miner- al inclusions as well as on experimentally determined phase relations, a prograde PT-path - simplified for water activity-- 1 - is constructed which passes through the approximate PT-conditions 16 kbar and 560 {\~{}} C, 29 kbar and 720 {\~{}} C, and finally up to 37 kbar at about 800 {\~{}} C, where the Mg-rich metapelite was a pyrope-coe- site rock with phengite, kyanite, and talc still present. During the retrograde path, pyrope was altered metaso- matically either into phlogopite + kyanite + quartz or, at a later stage, to chlorite +muscovite + quartz. Both as- semblages yield PT-constraints, the latter about 7- 9 kbar, 500-600 {\~{}} C. The country rock gneisses have also endured high-pressures of at least 15 kbar, but they pro- vide mostly constraints on the lowest portion of the uplift conditions within the greenschist facies (about 5 kbar, 450 {\~{}} C). Microprobe data are presented for the following minerals: pyrope, ellenbergerite, dumortierite (unusually MgTi-rich), jadeite, vermiculite (formed after Na-phlogo- pite?), paragonite, and for several generations of phen- gite, chlorite, talc, phlogopite, dravite, and glaucophane in the high-pressure rocks, as well as for biotite, chlorite, phengites, epidote, garnet, albite, and K-feldspar in the country rock gneisses. An outstanding open problem identified in this study is the preservation of minerals as inclusions within kyanite and pyrope beyond their PT-stability limits.},

abstract = {The new tectonic map of the Alps is based on the combination of purely structural data with criteria regarding paleogeographical affiliation and/or tectono-metamorphic evolution. The orogenic evolution of the Alps is discussed using a combination of maps and paleogeographical reconstructions. It is proposed that the Alps are the product of two orogenies, a Cretaceous followed by a Tertiary one. While the former is related to the closure of an embayment of the Meliata ocean into Apulia, the latter is due to the closure of the Alpine Tethys between Apulia and Europe. The along-strike changes in the overall architecture, as for example revealed by geophysical-geological transects, are by far more substantial than hitherto believed. It appears that the Alps are still far from being over-investigated, as is demonstrated by many surprising recent findings based on field geology, laboratory results and geophysical methods of deep sounding.},

abstract = {A complete Alpine cross section integrates numerous seismic reflection and refraction profiles, across and along strike, with published and new field data. The deepest parts of the profile are constrained by geophysical data only, while structural features at intermediate levels are largely depicted according to the results of three-dimensional models making use of seismic and field geological data. The geometry of the highest structural levels is constrained by classical along-strike projections of field data parallel to the pronounced easterly axial dip of all tectonic units. Because the transect is placed close to the western erosional margin of the Austroalpine nappes of the Eastern Alps, it contains all the major tectonic units of the Alps. A model for the tectonic evolution along the transect is proposed in the form of scaled and area-balanced profile sketches. Shortening within the Austroalpine nappes is testimony of a separate Cretaceous-age orogenic event. West directed thrusting in these units is related to westward propagation of a thrust wedge resulting from continental collision along the Meliata-Hallstatt Ocean further to the east. Considerable amounts of oceanic and continental crustal material were subducted during Tertiary orogeny, which involved some 500 km of N-S convergence between Europe and Apulia. Consequently, only a very small percentage of this crustal material is preserved within the nappes depicted in the transect. Postcollisional shortening is characterized by the simultaneous activity of gently dipping north directed detachments and steeply inclined south directed detachments, both detachments nucleating at the interface between lower and upper crust. Large scale wedging of the Adriatic (or Apulian) lower crust into a gap opening between the subduced European lower crust and the pile of thin upper crustal flakes (Alpine nappes) indicates a relatively strong lower crust and detachment between upper and lower crust.},

abstract = {We developed a plate tectonic model for the Paleozoic and Mesozoic (Ordovician to Cretaceous) integrating dynamic plate boundaries, plate buoyancy, ocean spreading rates and major tectonic and magmatic events. Plates were constructed through time by adding/removing oceanic material, symbolized by synthetic isochrons, to major continents and terranes. Driving forces like slab pull and slab buoyancy were used to constrain the evolution of paleo-oceanic domains. This approach offers good control of sea-floor spreading and plate kinematics. This new method represents a distinct departure from classical continental drift reconstructions, which are not constrained, due to the lack of plate boundaries. This model allows a more comprehensive analysis of the development of the Tethyan realm in space and time. In particular, the relationship between the Variscan and the Cimmerian cycles in the Mediterranean–Alpine realm is clearly illustrated by numerous maps. For the Alpine cycle, the relationship between the Alpides senso stricto and the Tethysides is also explicable in terms of plate tectonic development of the Alpine Tethys–Atlantic domain versus the NeoTethys domain.},

abstract = {Reconstructions of the Tethyan realm have been a matter of debate for a long time. Controversies spring usually from a lack of well constrained geological data which can be interpreted in different ways, or, from a lack of constraints on the plate tectonics framework. The western Alps region tends to escape these shortcomings due to a wealth of geological data regarding for examples the rifting and spreading of the Alpine Tethys and its closure, the formation of the Alpine orogenic wedge and accompanying foreland basins, through precise datation of these many events. The larger plate tectonic framework is also well constrained through precise positioning, at least since the Jurassic, of the main plates surrounding the western Alpine Tethys domain, such as the European and African plates, but also the Iberic and Adria micro-plates and the Alboran fragments. Therefore, the Western Alps and surrounding regions represent a key-stone for the western Tethys reconstruction. A detail account of the geological evolution along a western Swiss Alps transect is presented here and confronted to the plate tectonic models derived from a larger western Tethys data base.},

abstract = {The significance of the Brian{\c{c}}onnais domain in the Alpine orogen is reviewed in the light of data concerning its collision with the active Adriatic margin and the passive Helvetic margin. The Brian{\c{c}}onnais which formerly belonged to the Iberian plate, was located on the northern margin of the Alpine Tethys (Liguro-Pi{\'{e}}mont ocean) since its opening in the early-Middle Jurassic. Together with the Iberian plate the Brian{\c{c}}onnais terrane was separated from the European plate in the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous, following the northern Atlantic, Bay of Biscay, Valais ocean opening. This was accompanied by the onset of subduction along the northern margin of Adria and the closure of the Alpine Tethys. Stratigraphic and metamorphic data regarding this subduction and the geohistory of the Brian{\c{c}}onnais allows the scenario of subduction–obduction processes during the Late Cretaceous–early Tertiary in the eastern and western Alps to be specified. HP–LT metamorphism record a long-lasting history of oceanic subduction-accretion, followed in the Middle Eocene by the incorporation of the Brian{\c{c}}onnais as an exotic terrane into the accretionary prism. Middle to Late Eocene cooling ages of the Brian{\c{c}}onnais basement and the presence of pelagic, anorogenic sedimentation lasting until the Middle Eocene on the Brian{\c{c}}onnais preclude any sort of collision before that time between this domain and the active Adria margin or the Helvetic margin. This is confirmed by plate reconstructions constrained by magnetic anomalies in the Atlantic domain. Only a small percentage of the former Brian{\c{c}}onnais domain was obducted, most of the crust and lithospheric roots were subducted. This applies also to domains formerly belonging to the southern Alpine Tethys margin (Austroalpine–inner Carpathian domain). It is proposed that there was a single Palaeogene subduction zone responsible for the Alpine orogen formation (from northern Spain to the East Carpathians), with the exception of a short-lived Late Cretaceous partial closure of the Valais ocean. Subduction in the western Tethyan domain originated during the closure of the Meliata ocean during the Jurassic incorporating the Austroalpine–Carpathian domain as terranes during the Cretaceous. The subduction zone propagated into the northern margin of Adria and then to the northern margin of the Iberian plate, where it gave birth to the Pyrenean–Proven{\c{c}}al orogenic belt. This implies the absence of a separated Cretaceous subduction zone within the Austro-Carpathian Penninic ocean. Collision of Iberia with Europe forced the subduction to jump to the SE margin of Iberia in the Eocene, creating the Apenninic orogenic wedge and inverting the vergence of subduction from south- to north-directed.},

Field and petrographic analyses have allowed us to classify these turbiditic successions as multisource deposits, as demonstrated by the common presence of allochemical, mainly bioclastic detritus, associated with different types of terrigenous arenites. For all units, field data suggest more proximal sources for allochemical supply and distal sources for terrigenous material, characterized by the presence of chert, carbonate rocks, and metamorphic rock fragments. All the investigated successions display transparent heavy mineral associations, marked by the common presence of chrome spinel, alkaline amphibole, staurolite, epidote, and zoisite, which point to similar metamorphic sources. The location of the source of metamorphic rock fragments is uncertain, but inputs from the internal Dinaric belt are possible. The source of the allochemical detritus was located in the nearby reactivated Friuli Platform.},

abstract = {Outcrops of eclogites and retroeclogites occur in the normal limb of the Siviez-Mischabel fold nappe (Penninic Alps, Wallis, Switzerland). The ecologites are contained in the gneisses of the Ergischhorn and Barneuza units (Turtmanntal and Val de Moiry) where they usually associate with banded amphibolites. High-pressure mineral assemblages in the eclogites (pyrope-rich almandine and omphacite) are overprinted by later amphibolite- and greenschist-facies metamorphic minerals. According to Coleman's classification, the eclogites belong to the B type with P T values around 650??C for a minimum pressure of 15 kb. Geochemical investigations suggest a tholeiitic basalt affinity. Some problems still remain to solve. These are: (1) the geodynamic contexts and (2) the age of the eclogite facies overprint, whether Alpine or pre-Alpine. In the absence of radiometric ages, the following arguments favour a pre-Alpine (lower Paleozoic or older) age of the high-pressure metamorphism: 1. (1) The presence of polymetamorphic paragenesis, the eclogitic mineral assemblages being the oldest, 2. (2) The B type of the eclogites which are associated tectonically with polymetamorphic gneisses, 3. (3) The presence, in the same tectonic units, of Permian gabbros which show no signs of eclogite-facies overprint, 4. (4) The presence of autochthonous sedimentary cover rocks that have been dated Triassic to Eocene. This makes it difficult to assume an eo-Alpine (Cretaceous) subduction of the underlying basement, 5. (5) The existence of striking similarity with other pre-Alpine eclogites related to a Lower Paleozoic (500-460 Ma) high-pressure event well documented in some Alpine and extra-Alpine basement units. It could have associated with a Caledonian subduction of oceanic crust. ?? 1990.},

The apatite FT data provides evidence for a burial depth of at least 6 km for the samples, which were totally reset. Burial was not deeper than 11 km, since the zircon fission-track system was not reset. The RDFZ represents an accretionary wedge with a complex burial and cooling history due to successive and differential accretion and exhumation. The sedimentary sequences were deposited along a convergent margin, where accretion started before Maastrichtian and lasted until Miocene. Accretion propagated from a central area (Salzburg-Ybbsitz) both to the west and to the east. In the west, accretion lasted from Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene, reflecting underplating of the RDFZ by the European continental margin sediments. In the east, where three nappes (Greifenstein, Kahlenberg and Laab nappes) can be distinguished, the exhumation started between Late Oligocene and Early Miocene. The Kahlenberg and Laab nappes show total resetting of the apatite FT ages, while in the Greifenstein nappe there is only partial resetting. According to a new paleogeographic reconstruction, the Kahlenberg and Laab nappes were placed on top of the Greifenstein nappe by an out-of-sequence thrust.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the general features of Mesozoic and Tertiary rock sequences and paleogeography in the Alps. It seeks to outline the paleotectonic significance of the rocks and to discuss the structural evolution of the Alpine geosyncline up to the main deformation, with special reference to the sector between the rivers Rhine and Durance. Accent is placed on the relative independence of Alpine structures involving the pre-Triassic basement rocks and of cover nappes consisting only of Mesozoic and Tertiary formations. Normal shallow-water deposits of platform or miogeosynclinal type were laid down over the whole area before eugeosynclinal conditions set in. The typical eugeosynclinal sediments in the central, Penninic belt of the Alps are the Schistes lustr{\'{e}}s and B{\"{u}}ndnerschiefer, with sills and submarine lava flows of basic volcanic rocks (ophiolites). Before metamorphism they consisted mainly of shales and of impure arenaceous and argillaceous limestones. The bathymetric environment of radiolarian cherts and associated rocks is examined, and their deep-water origin is upheld for the Alpine occurrences. Marine polygenic breccias are characteristic of geosynclinal slopes (commonly fault scarps) and not of a particular depth zone. The Alpine Flysch is a particularly significant sediment. Flysch is a thick marine deposit of predominantly detrital rocks, in part turbidites, generally without volcanic rocks, and laid down during compressional deformation of the geosyncline. Of the many different kinds of Flysch some represent transitions to either B{\"{u}}ndnerschiefer or Molasse. Essential differences between the early synorogenic Flysch and the later synorogenic to post-orogenic Molasse are listed. Argand's stimulating embryotectonic theory of the evolution of the geosyncline is outlined and rejected. The Triassic corresponds to a neutral interval, between the Hercynian and Alpine cycles. Early Alpine geosynclinal history was characterized by vertical or tensional movements along normal faults that limited narrow platforms and rapidly subsiding troughs. This tensional deformation weakened in the Late Jurassic, whereupon bottom relief diminished, and "para-oceanic" conditions prevailed over a large part of the Mediterranean realm. New linear welts of compressional origin arose during the Cretaceous and developed into steep island chains limiting the Flysch basins. Gradually the central part of the Alps rose above sea level, and the geosyncline migrated to the north and west. Here it was finally filled and gave way to the foreland trough in which the Molasse was laid down. There is no simple, direct, genetic and space relationship between Hercynian structures, fault-bordered platforms and troughs of the earlier geosynclinal phase, island chains and basins of the Flysch phase, and the later nappe structures. Paleogeographical features are commonly short-lived and migratory.},

abstract = {Plate-tectonic interpretations of sandstone composition are made in the hope that "detrital framework modes of sandstone suites provide information about the tectonic setting of basins of deposition and associated provenances" (Dickinson et al. 1983). The underlying assumption that provenance tectonics are directly "'associated" with tectonics of depositional and post- depositional sedimentary settings is not, however, universally true, as sandstones from two contemporary accretionary prism complexes (Nias Island, Indonesia, and Barbados, West Indies) illustrate. Mineralogically immature sandstones rich in feldspar and volcanic lithic fragments are expected in such tectonic settings, but both Nias Island and Barbadian sandstones are mineralogically very mature, dominated by quartz. In both cases this discrepancy between inferred and actual tectonic setting has been explained by postulating that sands from a provenance petrogenetically unrelated to the arc-trench system (e.g., continental or recycled orogen sands) have been introduced into the accretionary prism by sedimentary or tectonic processes. Sandstones which are transported (sedimentologically or tectonically) across the boundaries of sedimentary-tectonic provinces, and which therefore occur in tectonic settings petrogenetically unrelated to the tectonics of the sediment source area, are important components of at least some active acccretionary complexes. The possibility of "trans-boundary" sedimentary and/or tectonic transport must be allowed for in making plate-tectonic interpretations based on sandstone petrography, especially in reconstructions of ancient orogenic belts.},

abstract = {Along the Western Alps there is geological evidence of late-Alpine (Oligocene) magmatic activity which clearly postdates the Lepontine (Eocene-early Oligocene) metamorphism and related deformation of the Alpine nappe pile. This magmatic activity was notably delayed in relation to the most important convergent processes and may be related to buoyancy of lithosphere, tensional tectonics and thermal updoming subsequent to the collision between the Eurasian and African plates. The geochemical features of the rocks and the geophysical characteristics of the Alpine chain, suggest that: (a) shoshonitic and calcalkaline melts may have been generated by partial melting of metasomatized peridotitic material and subsequent fractional crystallization and crustal contamination; silicic andesites and latites, however, could have been also derived from metasomatized eclogite or deep continental crust material; (b) the ultrapotassic lamprophyres with high K, P, LREE, Th, Zr, U and high 87Sr/86Sr ratios were generated by partial melting of strongly metasomatized mantle; the varied Sr-isotopic ratios may partially also reflect additional radiogenic component from the continental crust following magma segregation from the source.},

abstract = {Type and amount of sediment generation are intimately connected to tectonic and climatic processes active at the earth's surface today as well as throughout the geologic past. Detrital single grains (sand to very coarse silt sized) from well-dated sedimentary formations serve as mineral tracers in sedimentary systems and record the sediment-forming processes. In this review, a selection of individual methods available to extract petrogenetic and chronological information from detrital mineral grains is compiled. Emphasis is placed on techniques, concepts, and their possibilities and shortcomings in defining the type and geologic history of source rocks, as well as the rates and relative proportions at which sediments are being eroded and delivered to basins. Statistical issues intrinsically coupled to the interpretation of detrital single-grain distributions are highlighted, as well as new emerging techniques. These include geochronology of phases like e.g. titanite, monazite, or rutile to overcome the common restriction to apatite or zircon bearing lithologies, as well as any kind of double or triple dating to extract both high-T and low-T thermochronological information from the very same detrital grains. Mineral pairs are especially suited to quantify the relative contributions of well-defined source rocks or areas to the sediment when the two phases (i) occur in contrasting rock types, (ii) are relatively stable under sedimentary conditions, and (iii) allow for extracting significant and detailed information on source rock petrology and chronology. In general, however, multi-method approaches are the only way to overcome ambiguous information from the sedimentary record. In combination with either independent information on sediment flux or erosion rates derived from single-grain thermochronology, the sediment-forming processes as well as their controlling mechanisms and overall geologic settings can be properly assessed.},

abstract = {The detrital components of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the Northern Calcareous Alps reflect the early Alpine geodynamic evolution of the Austroalpine microplate. Two contrasting source areas are distinguished on the base of light and heavy mineral analysis. The first source area is located at the southeastern margin of the Austroalpine and is composed of Palaeozoic sediments and metamorphic rocks, Mesozoic carbonate rocks, and ultrabasic rocks derived from the suture zone of the Vardar/Meliata Ocean. The second source area is located in the northwest in a Lower Austroalpine position near the transpressive plate margin that juxtaposes Austroalpine and Penninic units. This source area comprises Palaeozoic low-grade metamorphic rocks including high-pressure (HP) rocks, late Palaeozoic (meta)sediments, Mesozoic carbonate rocks, and ultrabasic rocks from obducted slices of Penninic oceanic crust. Chemical analyses of detrital white mica, amphibole and garnet support the discrimination between the two source areas. Tourmaline chemistry calls for a significant amount of metasedimentary rocks in the source area. Granitoid rocks and high-grade metamorphic rocks are rare. Blue amphibole, phengite, and chloritoid composition suggest the erosion of lower blueschist facies rocks in the northwestern source area. We suggest a modified model of Austroalpine Valanginian to Coniacian tectono-sedimentary evolution which is based on (1) an onset of subduction of the Penninic Ocean no earlier than Late Cretaceous, (2) deposition of the analyzed sedimentary rocks in piggyback basins, and (3) a reconstruction of provenance as proposed in this study.},

abstract = {The Theodul Glacier Unit (TGU) at “Trockener Steg” represents a continental slice, embedded within the ophiolitic Zermatt–Saas Zone. The Zermatt–Saas Zone is the remnant of the Piemonte–Liguria oceanic lithosphere, formed in the middle Jurassic and subducted up to eclogite facies conditions in the Early Tertiary. The close spatial association of the TGU to the Zermatt–Saas Zone permits a comparison of the metamorphic evolution of the units by detailed field mapping and a petrological investigation of eclogites. The eclogites from both tectono-metamorphic units can be clearly distinguished by their textures, mineral assemblages and by mineral and bulk-rock composition. Geothermobarometry and computed assemblage stability diagrams for the TGU eclogites indicate P–T conditions of 2.2±0.1GPa and 580±50°C. These derived P–T conditions must be considered as minimum peak metamorphic conditions the rocks achieved during subduction. The P–T data are different from those derived for eclogites of Zermatt–Saas Zone adjacent to the Theodul Glacier Unit, that reached maximal burial depths at 2.3–2.4GPa and 500±50°C. While the estimates of the eclogites of Zermatt–Saas Zone are in good agreement with some of the previous studies, the contrasting P–T estimates for the TGU eclogites suggest that the Zermatt–Saas complex must be subdivided into several tectonic subunits. The non-uniform peak conditions over the “Trockener Steg” area and the maximum pressures conditions reported from ultra-high pressure localities within Zermatt–Saas Zone suggest, that individual tectonic slices have been assembled after detachment from the slab at the return-point, i.e. along the exhumation path. Detached packages of rocks may range from small tectonic slices up to several kilometer-sized fragments. The TGU is separated from the surrounding rocks of the ophiolite unit by two major tectonic contacts. In addition, the formation of biotite-rich crusts along the basal contact of the TGU is evidence of prolonged fluid channeling along the basal thrust. The presence of hydrous decompression assemblages replacing earlier formed high-pressure mineral assemblages within the studied eclogite suggests that fluids were present throughout most of the TGU exhumation history.},

abstract = {Detrital modes are the basic type of quantitative data used in sedimentary petrology. They represent estimates of the petrographic framework composition of sand or sandstone obtained by point counting of thin sections. At present, geological inferences from analysis of these numerical data are semi-quantitative only, because many of the data-processing methods employed in sedimentary petrology lack a firm theoretical basis. A review of existing methods reveals a number of fundamental statistical problems associated with the use of univariate statistics and the construction of so-called hexagonal fields of compositional variation. It is shown that these problems can be overcome by using multivariate methods that honour the non-negativity and unit-sum constraints on compositional data, and incorporate the covariance structure. Spread in compositional data can be modelled on two levels: (1) by regarding the grain as unit of observation, and the total point count as a sample from a multinomial distribution; (2) by regarding the total count as unit of observation, and a set of counts as a sample from an additive logistic normal distribution. Numerical methods are presented for constructing statistically rigorous confidence regions in ternary diagrams by inversion of significance tests for these two distributions. Statistical analyses of the framework composition and heavy-mineral assemblages of modern beach and river sands illustrate their use. The case histories are followed by a brief overview of popular multivariate methods for reconstructing sediment provenance.},

abstract = {Nearly 30 years have elapsed since Kretz (1983) provided the mineralogical community with a systematized list of abbre- viations for rock-forming minerals and mineral components. Its logic and simplicity have led to broad acceptance among authors and editors who were eager to adopt a widely recognized set of mineral symbols to save space in text, tables, and figures. Few of the nearly 5000 known mineral species occur in nature with a frequency sufficient to earn repeated mention in the geoscience literature and thus qualify for the designation “rock-forming mineral,” but a reasonable selection of the most common and useful rock-forming minerals likely numbers in the several hundreds. The original list by Kretz (1983) contained abbreviations for 193 of these. We propose an expansion to the list initiated by Kretz (1983) (see next page). Modest expansions and revisions were made by Spear (1993), Holland and Powell (1998), the Mineralogical As- sociation of Canada, and Siivola and Schmid (2007). Our revised list of abbreviations has 371 entries. Significant numbers of the new entries are the result of three decades of research in high- and ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic terrains, the explicit inclusion of Mg and Fe end-members of solid-solution series (as in the amphi- boles), recent work on extraterrestrial samples, and the increased relevance to petrology of numerous accessory minerals.},

abstract = {Detrital garnet provenance analysis was carried out on sandstones of the Cretaceous Yukawa Formation in the Shimanto belt of central Kii Peninsula, Southwest Japan. The Yukawa Formation is an upper con- tinental slope deposit of late Albian to Turonian age. The sandstones of the Yukawa Formation in central Kii Peninsula are feldspathic-lithic sandstones. Spessartine-almandine garnets containing some pyrope and grossular contents and originating from low to intermediate grade metamorphic rocks and felsic igneous rocks are the main components of the Yukawa assemblage in the study area. Pyrope-rich almandine garnet derived from granulite-facies metamorphic rocks originating from psammitic or pelitic rocks also occur, along with grandite garnet derived from metamorphosed calcareous rocks, and minor amounts of high P/T garnet sourced from mafic gneiss and garnet-amphibolite. The source area for garnets derived from granitoids and low to inter- mediate grade metamorphic rocks, thermally metamorphosed noncal- careous and calcareous rocks is considered to be the Higo belt that may be a constituent of the Paleo-Ryoke belt. The source of granulite- facies metamorphic garnets was probably Precambrian continental basement in East Asia, possibly the Korean Peninsula or North China. Eclogite-origin and high P/T garnets may have been derived from the Kurosegawa belt. The presence or absence of eclogite-origin garnets, appearance and disappearance of grandite garnets and their different concentrations in coeval deposits indicate the detritus supplied to the Yukawa depocenter was heterogenous, due to varying proportions of lithotypes in the individual source regions.

abstract = {Deep-sea turbidite sedimentation in convergent margin settings generally is controlled by tectonic uplift, climate and eustatic sea-level variations. The rate of tectonic uplift governs the relief of the source area and the position of the base level (coinciding with sea-level), climate influences the rate and style of weathering and continental runoff and eustatic seal-level additionally shifts the base level, functioning with the concurrently working tectonic movements. Thus, these factors primarly determine the availability of sediment (yield and nature of material and the site of intermittent storage) at the basin margin which is unlocked periodically to flow downslope to the basin. This paper attempts to decipher quantitatively the importance of the individual factors in the Late Maastrichtian to Early Eocene Schieren Flysch Croup. The flysch was deposited in a moderately converging remnant oceanic trench basin. Mean parameters are calculated on the basis of formations and the duration of nannofossil zones comprised in. For transposing these zone into absolute age intervals the problem of inconsistent durations in current time scales had to be solved by a best-fit approach. Frequencies and periodicities of turbidite events, decompacted and compacted sedimentation rates (the latter are considered as apparent denudation rates) are calculated to reveal the dynamics of sedimentation. Climatic evidence is deduced from clay mineralogy. Changing uplift rates in the drainage area are indirectly interpreted from back-stripped tectonic subsisdence rates in the basin. The obtained data point to an immediate control of sub-duction-Iinked tectonic uplift in the bordering drainage and shelf area on turbidite sedimentation, as frequency and thickness of the turbidite events are closely correlated with the increasing tectonic subsisdence in the basin (assumed to match the rate of subduction and underplating). This general trend is modified by the temporary migration of the oceanic hinge zone towards the trench causing periodically the starvation of outer portions of the basin at the transition from Early to Late Paleocene and Late Paleocene to Eocene. Regional climatic trends additionnaly rule the turbidite facies development and apparent denudation rates. In the upper part of Early Eocene series high rate mud dominated sediments correlate with warm/humid conditions and in Late Paleocene deposits low rate sandy sediments coincide with cool ones. During the Late Paleocene period the global 2nd-order sea-level lowering probably may be responsible for the by-passing of the shelf by the coarse grained sediments.},

abstract = {The Late Maastrichtian to Middle Eocene Gurnigel-Schlieren Flysch is analysed from the point of view of tectonic control on deposition. Facies show an alternation of abyssal plain/oceanic slope, trench fill channellized and non-channellized sediments and finally lower slope deposits. The facies evolution points to a sporadically active subduction trench environment. A detailed picture of the sediment dispersal pattern is deduced from framework-grain analysis, feldspar and lithic fragment counts and conglomerate analysis on current oriented samples. This picture includes 10 major and 3 minor depositional systems which varied in time and space. Variation was influenced by tectonic movements in the basin and source areas, and by sea-level changes. Smoothing out of late Alpine deformation reveals a west-east trending elongated basin geometry and sediment distribution pattern. Flow directions which do not fit with the model are discussed: the Eocene subduction-related rotation of parts of the basin is suggested to have disrupted an initially coherent flow pattern. The sequence was deposited within a remnant of the South Penninic Ligurian ocean, in a trench environment bordered by a continental margin arc.},

abstract = {Bentonite beds and a few ferro-manganiferous layers are described from the Late Maastrichtian to Middle (Late?) Eocene Gurnigel-, Schlieren- and W{\"{a}}gital-Flysch Formations. The generally yellow, sometimes white bentonites appear as several mm-, and in few cases cm-thick, slightly graded beds. They are particularly frequent in the Upper Maastrichtian and Lower Eocene parts of the flysch series. The occurrence of the bentonites is generally linked to an association of fine-grained turbiditic and carbonate-free green hemipelagic sediments deposited on the abyssal plain and oceanic slope of the flysch basin. It is assumed that the flysch sediments were deposited in a long and narrow South Peninic remanent oceanic basin where repeatedly compressional tectonic movements took place and controlled the sediment dispersal pattern (Winkler 1984b, Winkler etal. 1985). The volcanic origin of the clay seams is suggested by the abundance of montmorillonite in the clay fraction, the typical heavy mineral assemblage and the presence of pyroclastic fragments. The bentonite composition was investigated by clay mineral, heavy mineral and Rontgen fluorescence analysis in order to reveal the nature of the volcanic sources from which the ash beds were derived. It appears that the Late Maastrichtian bentonites are compositionally different from the Eocene ones: The Early Eocene bentonites are much richer in Ti02 (about 6-7{\%}), P2O5, Zr, Zn and Cu. In Late Maastrichtian bentonites heavy minerals are very rare, whereas the Early Eocene bentonites contain associations largely dominated by apatite. The clay mineralogy and chemical composition clearly reflect the middle diagenetic stage overprint altering the primary composition of the ashes and therefore no conclusions on the volcanic sources seem possible. However, some Eocene bentonites contain recrystallized pyroclasts which were analyzed in detail. From the mineralogical (plagioclase and berthierine) and chemical composition it can be concluded on a basic to inter¬ mediate magmatic source. The major element composition of the pyroclasts and of the whole rock sample show considerable differences, comparable to the element exchange observed during submarine alteration of tholeiitic pillow lavas to palagonite/montmorillonite as described by Staudigel {\&} Hart (1983). Using the correction factors based on Staudigel {\&} Hart's data and the discrepancies between our pyroclasts and their alteration products, we assumed that an approximate original composition of the ash layers could be determinable. Together with the immobile element content (Winchester {\&} Floyd 1977), these primary compositions point to andesitic sources for Late Maastrichtian and to alkali basaltic (trachybasaltic) ones for Early Eocene bentonites. An Early Thanetian bentonite is especially rich in heavy minerals (apatite, zircon). From the zircon typology (Pupin 1980) it appears that the ash was probably derived from a volcanic source with a calcalkaline, granodioritic composition. In the Alps the record of synorogenic volcanism is poor. The provenance of our bentonites can only be discussed based on the preserved occurrence of coeval volcanites. ')},

abstract = {We examine the structures of the biggest and best exposed unit of the Prealpine nappe stack, the Klippen nappe in the eastern Pr{\'{e}}alpes Romandes. During the Alpine orogeny, the Klippen nappe was incorporated into the accretionary wedge of the closing Pi{\'{e}}mont ocean, detached from the basement along a basal evaporite horizon and transported onto the foreland in a thin-skinned tectonic style. The stratigraphy of this cover nappe changes significantly parallel and perpendicular to strike. These variations give rise to changes in structural style of the cover nappe, from mainly fold structures in the north to large imbricates in the south. Results from our field study, previous work and seismic data permit the subdivision of the cover sequence into 5 sectors from north to south, which arc-separated by thrust faults. This subdivision is the basis for the reconstruction of the Klippen nappe paleobasin. This basin is crosscut by a number of synsedimentary paleofaults. Our model of emplacement and internal deformation of the Klippen nappe suggests that ramping and stacking of imbricates in the southern part of the nappe is controlled by the low thickness and insufficient continuity of the evaporite layers below the massive carbonate units. The fault-related fold structures in the northern part seem to be influenced by the larger thickness of these evaporites and the presence of heterogeneities which resulted from synsedimentary faults within the interlayered carbonate sequences.},

abstract = {The internal textures of detrital polycrystalline quartz can be used to distinguish between polycrystalline quartz populations derived from different crystalline source rocks. This is supported by the petrographic examination of the quartz fraction in 65 metamorphic rocks with known metamorphic histories and the detrital polycrystalline quartz populations in 57 samples of medium sand-size Holocene fluvial sand derived from known crystalline source rocks. Empirical observations by metamorphic petrologists have shown that quartz crystal sizes increase systematically with increase in metamorphic grade of the rocks. Petrographic examination of quartz crystals deformed in controlled laboratory experiments have shown quartz responds to stress via a systematic series of processes: deformation, recovery, primary recrystallization, and secondary recrystallization. Deformation is reflected optically by undulose extinction, deformation lamellae and bands, elongated crystal units, and sutured crystal-crystal boundaries. Recovery is recognized optically be segmented extinction (semi-composite extinction) reflecting polygonization of the crystal. Primary recrystallization occurs when strain-free areas surrounded by dislocation tangles form new crystals, and is recognized optically by the presence of small (50 mu m), nonundulose crystals. Secondary recrystallization develops large, nonundulose, strain-free polyhedral crystals with smooth crystal-crystal boundaries. Deformation, recovery, and primary recrystallization features characterize quartz in greenschist-grade metamorphic rocks. Detrital quartz grains with these features are, for the lack of a better term, called "unstable", reflecting the transformation from old crystals to new, recrystallized crystals. Detrital polycrystalline quartz with features of secondary recrystallization are called "stable" grains, and are derived from medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks. Detrital polycrystalline quartz grains derived from intrusive igneous rocks are also characterized by "stable" features. A plot of a polycrystallinity index (the ratio of detrital polycrystalline quartz with more than 3 crystal units per grain to total detrital polycrystalline quartz) vs. an instability index (the ratio of detrital polycrystalline quartz with "unstable" characteristics to total detrital polycrystalline quartz) discriminates between medium sand-size polycrystalline quartz populations in Holocene sands derived from low-, and medium- to high-grade metamorphic source rocks Detrital polycrystalline quartz populations in Holocene sands derived from granitic plutons partly overlap the medium- to high-grade field.},

A satisfactory scheme for the classification of such hybrid arenites is needed to provide an adequate framework for basra analysis. Criteria for the definition of the chief classes of arenites must distinguish between extrabasinal and intrabasinal detritus and minimize the dependence of arenite nomenclature on grain size. Four main groups of arenaceous grain types are recognized: 1) noncarbonate extrabasinal , 2) carbonate extrabasinal , 3) noncarbonate intrabasinal , and 4) carbonate intrabasinal . Their three dimensional configuration establishes a first-level classification of the main types of arenites. Two more groups of arenaceous modes, neovolcanic and carbonate particles of extra- or intrabasinal undetermined origin, are required for a practical scheme. The practicability of the suggested approach can be demonstrated in paleogeographic and paleotectonic reconstructions.},
