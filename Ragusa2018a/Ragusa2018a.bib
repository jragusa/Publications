abstract = {Since the publication of our previous time scale (Berggren and others, 1985c = BKFV85) a large amount of new magneto- and biostratigraphic data and radioisotopic ages have become available. An evaluation of some of the key magnetobiostratigraphic calibration points used in BKFV85, as suggested by high precision 40Ar/39Ar dating (e.g., Montanari and others, 1988; Swisher and Prothero, 1990; Prothero and Swisher, 1992; Prothero, 1994), has served as a catalyst for us in developing a revised Cenozoic time scale. For the Neogene Period, astrochronologic data (Shackleton and others, 1990; Hilgen, 1991) required re-evaluation of the calibration of the Pliocene and Pleistocene Epochs. The significantly older ages for the Pliocene-Pleistocene Epochs predicted by astronomical calibrations were soon corroborated by high precision 40Ar/39Ar dating (e.g., Baksi and others, 1992; McDougall and others, 1992; Tauxe and others, 1992; Walter and others, 1991; Renne and others, 1993). At the same time, a new and improved definition of the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic polarity sequence was achieved based on a comprehensive evaluation of global sea-floor magnetic anomaly profiles (Cande and Kent, 1992). This, in turn, led to a revised Cenozoic geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) based on standardization to a model of South Atlantic spreading history (Cande and Kent, 1992/1995 = CK92/95). This paper presents a revised (integrated magnetobiochronologic) Cenozoic time scale (IMBTS) based on an assessment and integration of data from several sources. Biostratigraphic events are correlated to the recently revised global polarity time scale (CK95). The construction of the new GPTS is outlined with emphasis on methodology and newly developed polarity history nomenclature. The radioisotopic calibration points (as well as other relevant data) used to constrain the GPTS are reviewed in their (bio)stratigraphic context. An updated magnetobiostratigraphic (re)assessment of about 150 pre-Pliocene planktonic foraminiferal datum events (including recently available high southern (austral) latitude data) and a new/modified zonal biostratigraphy provides an essentially global biostratigraphic correlation framework. This is complemented by a (re)assessment of nearly 100 calcareous nannofossil datum events. Unrecognized unconformities in the stratigraphic record (and to a lesser extent differences in taxonomic concepts), rather than latitudinal diachrony, is shown to account for discrepancies in magnetobiostratigraphic correlations in many instances, particularly in the Paleogene Period. Claims of diachrony of low amplitude ({\textless}2 my) are poorly substantiated, at least in the Paleocene and Eocene Epochs. Finally, we (re)assess the current status of Cenozoic chronostratigraphy and present estimates of the chronology of lower (stage) and higher (system) level units. Although the numerical values of chronostratigraphic units (and their boundaries) have changed in the decade since the previous version of the Cenozoic time scale, the relative duration of these units has remained essentially the same. This is particularly true of the Paleogene Period, where the Paleocene/Eocene and Eocene/Oligocene boundaries have been shifted {\~{}}2 my younger and the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary {\~{}}1 my younger. Changes in the Neogene time scale are relatively minor and reflect primarily improved magnetobiostratigraphic calibrations, better understanding of chronostratigraphic and magnetobiostratigraphic relationships, and the introduction of a congruent astronomical/paleomagnetic chronology for the past 6 my (and concomitant adjustments to magnetochron age estimates).},

abstract = {The flysch sequences of the Swiss Prealps (Alpine front ranges) are described and interpreted in the light of a decade of study by a group research project at Fribourg. The geographical and geological settings are illustrated. The stratigraphy and sedimentology, the sedimentary petrography and the geodynamic setting are discussed. Correlations within and outside the Prealps, as well as outstanding problems, are treated. The flysch units and sequences covered are the Gurnigel Flysch, the M{\'{e}}dianes Flysch, Helminthoid Flysch, Fouyet, Manche and Mocausa Flysch, Hundsr{\"{u}}ck Flysch, Niesen Flysch and the Ultrahelvetic Flysch. The data from clast, framework-grain and heavy mineral analysis, from micropalaeontology, from facies analysis, palaeocurrent measurements and stratigraphy allow the interpretation of sedimentary environments, source terranes and depositional models. In all cases, flysch deposits are deep marine detrital accumulations and source areas were undergoing active tectonics. Individual models are based on the deep-sea fan concept, but interpretations tend to show significant modifications with respect to simple fan characteristics. These departures are to some extent due to available grain size, to active structuring of basins or to minor controls such as eustatic variations or climatic influence. The integration of sedimentological data with stratigraphy and regional structure furnishes palinspastic reconstructions in map view. These provide insights on the palaeogeography of the Western Alps from Mid-Cretaceous to Oligocene and give a picture of the evolution of the Western Mediterranean Tethys during the same period. The relationship between flysch deposition and alpine mountain building is confirmed, while constraints on basin evolution are established.},

abstract = {The Upper Prealpine nappe of the Swiss and French Prealps consists of a composite stack of various tectonic slivers (Gets, Simme, Dranse and Sarine sub-nappes, from top to bottom). The structural superposition and stratigraphic content of the individual sub-nappes suggests a successive stacking at the South Penninic/Adriatic transition zone during the Late Cretaceous and Early Paleogene. The present paper deals with two aspects. (1) new data obtained from the Complexe de base Series of the Dranse sub-nappe which underlies the Helminthoid Sandstone Formation, and (2) the development of a geodynamic accretionary model for the Upper Prealpine nappe stacking. The Complexe de base Series reveals a succession of black shales at the base, grading upward into variegated red/green and red shales which were deposited in an abyssal plain environment starved of clastic input. It is overlain by the Helminthoid Sandstone Formation. The combined analysis of planktic and agglutinated benthic foraminifera and comparisons with other Tethyan series suggest an Albian to Campanian age of the Complexe de base succession. Tectonic transport of the abyssal plain segment into a trench environment allowed for the stratigraphic superposition by the Helminthoid sandstone sequence. The present findings combine well with the general scheme of the Upper Prealpine nappe stack and several single results on parts of the nappe stack. We take that opportunity to present a comprehensive model for the tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Upper Prealpine nappe. We suggest that Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous asymmetric (?) extension at the South Penninic-Adriatic margin created an extensional alloehthon. Later during the mid-Cretaceous, the start of convergence drove the obduction of oceanic crust on the northern margin of the extensional allochthon. The resulting ophiolitic/continental source supplied clasts to the trench basin in front (Manche turbidite series), and the backarc basin (Mocausa Formation) and abyssal plain (Perri{\`{e}}res turbidite series) to the South. During Middle to Late Coniacian the main Adriatic margin was thrusted over the obductionrelated mixed belt and established an incipient accretionary prism containing the former trench, backarc and abyssal plain basin fill series. During this stage the Gueyraz (melange) Complex formed, which separates the trench series from the retroarc and abyssal plain formations. On top of the incipient accretionary prism a forearc basin developed hosting the Hundsr{\"{u}}ck Formation. The frontal abyssal plain formation (Complexe de base) still received few turbiditic intercalations. From Campanian time on, the forearc basin was bypassed and deposition of the Helminthoid Sandstone Formation occurred on the Complexe de base succession. During the Maastrichtian the abyssal plain and trench fill succession (Dranse nappe) was accreted to the incipient wedge, and in front of a newly active buttress, the Gurnigel trench basin was established. Another accretionary event during latest Paleocene/earliest Eocene added parts of that trench series to the base of the wedge (Sarine nappe). During the Late Eocene the accretionary wedge and remaining trench fill series (Gurnigel nappe) were thrusted en-bloc over the Middle Penninic limestone nappes and partly overtook the latter. Continued shortening of the resulting nappe pile and out-of-sequence thrusting accomplished the overriding of the Middle Penninic units over the former South Penninic Gurnigel trench series (inversion of palaeogeographic domains).},

abstract = {A new reconstruction of Alpine Tethys combines plate-kinematic modelling with a wealth of geological data and seismic tomography to shed light on its evolution, from sea-floor spreading through subduction to collision in the Alps. Unlike previous models, which relate the fate of Alpine Tethys solely to relative motions of Africa, Iberia and Europe during opening of the Atlantic, our reconstruction additionally invokes independent microplates whose motions are constrained primarily by the geological record. The motions of these microplates (Adria, Iberia, Alcapia, Alkapecia, and Tiszia) relative to both Africa and Europe during Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic time involved the subduction of remnant Tethyan basins during the following three stages that are characterized by contrasting plate motions and driving forces: (1) 131–84 Ma intra-oceanic subduction of the Ligurian part of Alpine Tethys attached to Iberia coincided with Eo-alpine orogenesis in the Alcapia microplate, north of Africa. These events were triggered primarily by foundering of the older (170–131 Ma) Neotethyan subduction slab along the NE margin of the composite African–Adriatic plate; subduction was linked by a sinistral transform system to E–W opening of the Valais part of Alpine Tethys; (2) 84–35 Ma subduction of primarily the Piemont and Valais parts of Alpine Tethys which were then attached to the European plate beneath the overriding African and later Adriatic plates. NW translation of Adria with respect to Africa was accommodated primarily by slow widening of the Ionian Sea; (3) 35 Ma–Recent rollback subduction of the Ligurian part of Alpine Tethys coincided with Western Alpine orogenesis and involved the formation of the Gibraltar and Calabrian arcs. Rapid subduction and arc formation were driven primarily by the pull of the gravitationally unstable, retreating Adriatic and African slabs during slow convergence of Africa and Europe. The upper European–Iberian plate stretched to accommodate this slab retreat in a very mobile fashion, while the continental core of the Adriatic microplate acted as a rigid indenter within the Alpine collisional zone. The subducted lithosphere in this reconstruction can be correlated with slab material imaged by seismic tomography beneath the Alps and Apennines, as well as beneath parts of the Pannonian Basin, the Adriatic Sea, the Ligurian Sea, and the Western Mediterranean. The predicted amount of subducted lithosphere exceeds the estimated volume of slab material residing at depth by some 10–30{\%}, indicating that parts of slabs may be superposed within the mantle transition zone and/or that some of this subducted lithosphere became seismically transparent.},

abstract = {Flysch and molasse are discussed in the light of alpine geodynamics. They are pre-collision and post-collision orogenic clastics which accumulated in basins under different geodynamic controls. We propose that in the case of the Alps, their succession records the change in geodynamics from pre-collision inversion of shallower extensional structures, to post-collision inversion of one or more deep-seated features. The classical flysch of the Prealps, lying within a pile of nappes at the front of the Western Alps, are invariably turbidite deposits. Flysch has therefore acquired a sedimentological connotation over the years, and this has been emphasized over the last few decades. Turbidite facies were also laid down in marginal and foreland locations during and a little after the collision between the South and North Tethyan Alpine margins, and this has obscured the possible deeper signification of flysch and molasse. Geodynamic regimes dictate the subsidence behaviour of basins, so by use of geohistory analysis, the time and place of the onset of Molasse basin development may be located. This was at the southern margin of the Helvetic belt, from the start of the Oligocene. Along the Alpine traverse of Western Switzerland, the change in regime from flysch to molasse (i.e. from trench and forearc or retro-arc, to foreland basin deposits) suggests that a major deep-seated inversion structure was situated near the Helvetic-Ultrahelvetic boundary.},

abstract = {Arguments are presented to support the proposition that Ultrahelvetic Flysch basins were present on both sides of the Habkern island arc that was convex to the southeast during Paleocene time. The width of this Ultrahelvetic realm of sedimentation is estimated to have been at least 300 km in a northwest-southeast direction; this estimate is based upon comparison with the geometrical dimensions of modern basins and on paleoecological considerations. The deformational history of the Ultrahelvetic Flysch is interpreted in terms of plate tectonics. Two plates were involved, a Helvetic plate and a Penninic plate. The origin of the Flysch basins was related to the descent of the northward-moving Penninic plate under an island arc which was at the leading edge of the Helvetic plate. During late Eocene and early Oligocene, a plate flip took place and the Helvetic plate then descended below the Penninic plate. This reversal in plate relationships accounts for the occurrence of the discordant Bergell Pluton and concurrent andesitic volcanism, which supplied detritus to the North Helvetic Flysch.},

abstract = {Thin mm to cm thick bentonite layers of Paleocene to Early Eocene age in the Tonsteinschichten of the Schlieren Flysch represent volcanic ash layers. Heavy mineral analysis of the layers indicates basic to acidic volcanic sources. U/Pb dating of single zircon crystals of a Paleocene layer (WW1948) by LA-ICP-MS points to an eruption at 59.87 ± 0.41 Ma, whereas ID-TIMS shows an eruption age of 60.96 ± 0.07 Ma. Taking into account the external precision of LA-ICP-MS analyses of 1–2{\%} both ages are overlapping and indicate an apparent minimal durations of zircon crystallization of 350 ka. Hf-isotope analysis of the same zircon crystals reveals the hybrid character of the source magma. The geochemical composition of the pumice grains of all bentonite layers is strongly affected by alteration. Nevertheless, the original character of the volcanic source can be evaluated. The Paleocene ashes (Lower Tonsteinschichten, LT) show a more fractionated multi-element pattern than the ashes of Early Eocene (Upper Tonsteinschichten, UT). The LT ash series are of rhyodacite to dacite character whereas the UT ashes fall in the field of alkali basalts. Both ash series seem to originate from a within-plate volcanic setting according to their trace element concentrations. Geochemical and temporary counterparts can be found in ash layers from Anthering (Austria) and the Danish Basin. As proposed for those ashes, volcanism connected to the opening of the North Atlantic might be the source as well for the ashes in the Schlieren Flysch. By comparison of the composition of rocks from the British Paleogene Igneous Province BPIP and the Schlieren Flysch ashes many correlations can be drawn which supports the suggestion of a North Atlantic origin of the Alpine ashes.},

abstract = {The complexity of flow and wide variety of depositional processes operating in subaqueous density flows, combined with post-depositional consolidation and soft-sediment deformation, often make it difficult to interpret the characteristics of the original flow from the sedimentary record. This has led to considerable confusion of nomenclature in the literature. This paper attempts to clarify this situation by presenting a simple classification of sedimentary density flows, based on physical flow properties and grain-support mechanisms, and briefly discusses the likely characteristics of the deposited sediments. Cohesive flows are commonly referred to as debris flows and mud flows and defined on the basis of sediment characteristics. The boundary between cohesive and non-cohesive density flows (frictional flows) is poorly constrained, but dimensionless numbers may be of use to define flow thresholds. Frictional flows include a continuous series from sediment slides to turbidity currents. Subdivision of these flows is made on the basis of the dominant particle-support mechanisms, which include matrix strength (in cohesive flows), buoyancy, pore pressure, grain-to-grain interaction (causing dispersive pressure), Reynolds stresses (turbulence) and bed support (particles moved on the stationary bed). The dominant particle-support mechanism depends upon flow conditions, particle concentration, grain-size distribution and particle type. In hyperconcentrated density flows, very high sediment concentrations ({\textgreater}25 volume{\%}) make particle interactions of major importance. The difference between hyperconcentrated density flows and cohesive flows is that the former are friction dominated. With decreasing sediment concentration, vertical particle sorting can result from differential settling, and flows in which this can occur are termed concentrated density flows. The boundary between hyperconcentrated and concentrated density flows is defined by a change in particle behaviour, such that denser or larger grains are no longer fully supported by grain interaction, thus allowing coarse-grain tail (or dense-grain tail) normal grading. The concentration at which this change occurs depends on particle size, sorting, composition and relative density, so that a single threshold concentration cannot be defined. Concentrated density flows may be highly erosive and subsequently deposit complete or incomplete Lowe and Bouma sequences. Conversely, hydroplaning at the base of debris flows, and possibly also in some hyperconcentrated flows, may reduce the fluid drag, thus allowing high flow velocities while preventing large-scale erosion. Flows with concentrations {\textless}9{\%} by volume are true turbidity flows (sensu Bagnold, 1962), in which fluid turbulence is the main particle-support mechanism. Turbidity flows and concentrated density flows can be subdivided on the basis of flow duration into instantaneous surges, longer duration surge-like flows and quasi-steady currents. Flow duration is shown to control the nature of the resulting deposits. Surge-like turbidity currents tend to produce classical Bouma sequences, whose nature at any one site depends on factors such as flow size, sediment type and proximity to source. In contrast, quasi-steady turbidity currents, generated by hyperpycnal river effluent, can deposit coarsening-up units capped by fining-up units (because of waxing and waning conditions respectively) and may also include thick units of uniform character (resulting from prolonged periods of near-steady conditions). Any flow type may progressively change character along the transport path, with transformation primarily resulting from reductions in sediment concentration through progressive entrainment of surrounding fluid and/or sediment deposition. The rate of fluid entrainment, and consequently flow transformation, is dependent on factors including slope gradient, lateral confinement, bed roughness, flow thickness and water depth. Flows with high and low sediment concentrations may co-exist in one transport event because of downflow transformations, flow stratification or shear layer development of the mixing interface with the overlying water (mixing cloud formation). Deposits of an individual flow event at one site may therefore form from a succession of different flow types, and this introduces considerable complexity into classifying the flow event or component flow types from the deposits.},

@article{Mutti2009,
abstract = {The concept of turbidite has evolved so much since its original definition by Kuenen and Migliorini in 1950 – i.e. the deposit of turbidity currents exemplified by the sandy flysch successions of the Northern Apennines – that it is now used to define a variety of deposits, some of which have little in common with sandy flysch formations in terms of facies, geometry and geological significance. The extension of the concept to other geodynamic settings and deposits of non-siliciclastic composition is considered only briefly in the concluding sections. With the diffusion of the concept of turbidity current, in the 1950s and early 1960s, an entirely new branch of sedimentology came into being, concerned with the inventory of sedimentary structures, palaeocurrent measurements and bedding patterns. The most representative expression of this branch came from the ‘Dutch school' of Philip H. Kuenen and his students. Between the late 1960s and the mid-1970s, there was a new development: facies analysis, in terms of modern environments and depositional systems. This development led to the introduction and discussion of ‘fan models' that became an increasingly thorny issue with the accumulation of data from modern deep-marine settings. In particular, most researchers emphasized the importance of channel and lobe elements and their mutual relationships in space and time. These models may differ in terms of specific features, e.g. canyon-fed versus delta-fed ramp settings and terminology, but the basic distinction between channels (sediment pathways), lobes and basin plains (sheet-like depositional features) was and still is widely retained – a model that simply refers to a system where a distributary channel passes downstream to a depositional zone, like in most fluvio-deltaic systems. Great caution should, however, be exercised when comparing modern and ancient fans – a problem discussed at length in the Committee on Submarine Fans I convened by A.H. Bouma and held in Pittsburgh in 1982. Different data sets and geological contexts, scaling problems and terminology still cast doubt over how meaningful such a comparison may be. Despite the many problems encountered, the elemental approach provides an easy, essentially descriptive tool to significantly compare recent with ancient, recent with recent, and ancient with ancient systems. Beginning in the 1970s, process-oriented facies analysis led to increasingly complex facies classification schemes, which showed substantial departures from the classic Bouma sequence and introduced many new concepts: proximal versus distal sedimentation, sediment bypass and flow efficiency, in addition to deflection, reflection and ponding of turbidity currents in confined basins. During the last two decades, there has been an increased interest in attempting to interpret the incredibly detailed submarine landscapes obtained through advances in marine geology, technology and high-resolution three-dimensional seismic data provided by the oil industry. Outcrop ‘analogues' derived from orogenic belts are used commonly to improve the interpretation of seismic-reflection facies, although their actual value may be questioned in many cases. Seismic–stratigraphic concepts are used routinely to describe and interpret turbidite systems of continental margin basins where cyclic sea-level variations are thought to be essentially controlled by eustasy. These concepts are difficult to apply to flysch basins, where the tectonic control on the development of cycles of relative sea-level variations appears to be dominant. In particular, the huge volumes of sediment involved in the infill of flysch basins imply amounts of uplift of the source areas and subsidence of the receiving basins that clearly outstrip those of divergent continental margins controlled by eustasy and thermal subsidence. Cycles of tectonic uplift and denudation (Davisian-type cycles in the sense of Mutti et al., 1996) apparently play a major role here. Most recent attempts to understand turbidite deposition are related to the increased economic importance of turbidite sandbodies as hydrocarbon reservoirs in many offshore basins (e.g. Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, Brazil, the North Sea). The many problems inherent to this situation have been reviewed extensively in a workshop held in Parma in 2002; only some of these problems are reconsidered briefly in this paper. Sandy turbidite systems can be generated by the resedimentation of deltaic deposits through submarine slides or be derived directly from flood-generated hyperpycnal flows; in the latter case, climatic variations must have played a fundamental role in controlling flood frequency and magnitude with time. Recognizing these two different types of system is not always easy and requires a good understanding of the geological context of the basin under consideration and particularly of the role of marginal fluvio-deltaic systems from which turbidites are ultimately derived. Unfortunately, this kind of integrated analysis is still in its infancy. There are other types of turbidite deposits, such as the calcareous flysch of the Western Alps and the Northern Apennines, whose origin still remains a matter of debate in terms of sediment source and triggering mechanisms of large-volume turbidity currents essentially loaded with fine-grained biogenic sediment. Some authors have referred to these sediments either as ‘megaturbidites' or ‘seismoturbidites'. The importance of tectonic control and geodynamic setting is stressed for turbidite systems of orogenic belt basins, which is justified both by historical reasons (turbidites were from their recognition included in the definition of flysch) and recent studies of thrust belts. The time is now ripe for reconsidering these sediments within a broader framework that takes into account the enormous quantity of data and concepts that have been developed in the last 50 years; this in itself raises a problem, and no small one: the accuracy and quality of data collected in the field and the training of young scientists. How many field geologists are being produced in these times of increasingly computerized geology; and how good are they?},

abstract = {The marine fill of ancient foreland basins is primarily recorded by depositional systems consisting of facies and facies associations deposited by a variety of sediment gravity flows in shallow-marine, slope and basinal settings. Tectonism and climate were apparently the main factors controlling the sediment supply, accommodation and depositional style of these systems. In marginal deltaic systems, sedimentation is dominated by flood-generated hyperpycnal flows that build up impressive accumulations of graded sandstone beds in front of relatively small high-gradient fan-deltas and river deltas. During periods of tectonically forced lowstands of sealevel, these systems may commonly shift basinward to shelfal and slope regions. Instability along the edges of these lowstand deltas and sand-laden hyperpycnal flows generate immature and coarse-grained turbidite systems commonly confined within structural depressions and generally encased in distal delta-front and prodeltaic deposits. Because of the close vertical and lateral stratigraphic relations between deltaic and turbidite-like facies, these marginal systems are herein termed ‘mixed depositional systems'. They are very common in the fill of foreland basins and represent the natural link between deltaic and basinal turbidite sedimentation. Basinal turbidite systems form in deeper water elongate highly subsiding troughs (foredeeps) that developed in front of advancing thrust systems. The impressive volumes of sheet-sandstones that form the fill of these troughs suggest that basinal turbidite systems are likely to form following periods of dramatic tectonic uplift of adjacent orogenic wedges and related high-amplitude tectonically-forced sealevel lowstands. In such deep basinal settings, sediment flux to the sea is dramatically increased by newly formed sediment in fluvial drainage basins and the subaerial and submarine erosion of falling-sealevel deltaic deposits generated during the uplift. Turbidity currents are very likely to be mainly triggered by floods, via hyperpycnal flows and related sediment failures, but can fully develop only in large-scale erosional conduits after a phase of catastrophic acceleration and ensuing bulking produced by bed erosion. This process leads to deepening and widening of the conduits and the formation of large-volume highly efficient bipartite currents whose energy dissipation is substantially reduced by the narrow and elongate basin geometry. These currents can thus carry their sediment load over considerable distances down the basin axis.},

abstract = {New biostratigraphic, sedimentological and petrographic data and a thorough review of existing literature modify existing knowledge on the age, the sedimentology, the petrography and the palaeogeographic origin of the Gurnigel flysch from the Voirons massif (Haute Savoie, France). Planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy assigns the flysch to the upper Middle Eocene (zones P12 to P14) through to Lower Oligocene (zones P16 to P20) stages. This result contrasts with previous work, which assigned the unit to the Lower Palaeocene to upper Middle Eocene on the basis of calcareous nannofossil and dinoflagellate assemblages. The following findings suggest that the Voirons massif comprises several stacked flysch units that do not have exactly the same palaeogeographic origin: (i) the occurrence of flysch exposures in reverse stratigraphic order combined with the lack of evidence for bed overturning; (ii) the variability of palaeo-depositional settings inferred from different flysch outcrops of similar age; (iii) the differences in the heavy mineral content; and (iv) the anomalous superimposition of distal turbidites and/or basinal contourites (Saxel Marls) over proximal turbidites (Vouan Conglomerates). The young age of these kilometre-sized flysch slices precludes their hitherto postulated locus of deposition in the South-Penninic Ocean, and rather indicates a provenance from the Ultrahelvetic and/or North-Penninic (Valais) palaeogeographical domains. Finally, none of the nannofossil assemblages are contemporaneous with the observed planktonic foraminifera associations, suggesting that they have been reworked, dissolved, or just simply diluted and not found by earlier researchers. This study from the Voirons massif shows that planktonic foraminifera associations are a highly reliable biostratigraphic tool for obtaining accurate ages of flysch successions.},

abstract = {The Chablais Prealps (Haute-Savoie, France) represent a well-preserved accretionary wedge of the Western Alpine Tethys. They comprise a stack of sedimentary nappes related to palaeogeographic realms ranging from the Ultrahelvetic to the Southern Penninic. The provenance analysis is based on the Gazzi-Dickinson method, and on QEMSCAN{\textregistered} for heavy-minerals. The Quartzose petrofacies is the most important of the two sources, and supplied three of the four formations of the Voirons Flysch. It is similar to the sources that fed the other flyschs from the Gurnigel nappe. It is characterised by a mature, quartz-rich assemblage and a heavy mineral population dominated by apatite and the zircon-tourmaline-rutile mineral group. These observations suggest a Clastic wedge provenance. The Feldspathic petrofacies is derived from a feldspar-rich source associated with metamorphic clasts and a heavy mineral population dominated by garnet. This provenance characterises only one formation of the Voirons Flysch, and is related to the Axial Belt provenance. This provenance analysis shows that the Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene Voirons Flysch was fed by two sources, in contrast to the other flyschs of the Gurnigel nappe, and further suggests that this flysch was not deposited in the Piemont Ocean but in the Valais domain. Based on the results and comparative provenance analysis with the other flyschs of the Gurnigel nappe, we propose a generic feeding model which involves the Sesia-Dent Blanche nappe, the sedimentary nappes incorporated in the accretionary prism, and probably the Brian{\c{c}}onnais basement.},

abstract = {The early Paleogene experienced the most pronounced long-term warming trend of the Cenozoic, superimposed by transient warming events such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The consequences of climatic perturbations and associated changes on the evolution of carbonate platforms are relatively unexplored. Today, modern carbonate platforms, especially coral reefs are highly sensitive to environmental and climatic change, which raises the question how (sub)tropical reef systems of the early Paleogene reacted to gradual and sudden global warming, eutrophication of shelf areas, enhanced CO2 levels in an ocean with low Mg/Ca ratios. The answer to this question may help to investigate the fate of modern coral reef systems in times of global warming and rising CO2 levels. Here we present a synthesis of Tethyan carbonate platform evolution in the early Paleogene ({\~{}} 59–55 Ma) concentrating on coral reefs and larger foraminifera, two important organism groups during this time interval. We discuss and evaluate the importance of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors leading to the dissimilar evolution of both groups during the early Paleogene. Detailed analyses of two carbonate platform areas at low (Egypt) and middle (Spain) paleolatitudes and comparison with faunal patterns of coeval platforms retrieved from the literature led to the distinction of three evolutionary stages in the late Paleocene to early Eocene Tethys: Stage I, late Paleocene coralgal-dominated platforms at low to middle paleolatitudes; stage II, a transitional latest Paleocene platform stage with coralgal reefs dominating at middle paleolatitudes and larger foraminifera-dominated (Miscellanea, Ranikothalia, Assilina) platforms at low paleolatitudes; and stage III, early Eocene larger foraminifera-dominated (Alveolina, Orbitolites, Nummulites) platforms at low to middle paleolatitudes. The onset of the latter prominent larger foraminifera-dominated platform correlates with the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum. The causes for the change from coral-dominated platforms to larger foraminifera-dominated platforms are multilayered. The decline of coralgal reefs in low latitudes during platform stage II is related to overall warming, leading to sea-surface temperatures in the tropics beyond the maximum temperature range of corals. The overall low occurrence of coral reefs in the Paleogene might be related to the presence of a calcite sea. At the same time larger foraminifera started to flourish after their near extinction at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. The demise of coralgal reefs at all studied paleolatitudes in platform stage III can be founded on the effects of the PETM, resulting in short-term warming, eutrophic conditions on the shelves and acidification of the oceans, hampering the growth of aragonitic corals, while calcitic larger foraminifera flourished. In the absence of other successful carbonate-producing organisms, larger foraminifera were able to take over the role as the dominant carbonate platform inhabitant, leading to a stepwise Tethyan platform stage evolution around the Paleocene/Eocene boundary. This szenario might be also effective for threatened coral reef sites.},

The orogenic evolution of the Alps is discussed using a combination of maps and paleogeographical reconstructions. It is proposed that the Alps are the product of two orogenies, a Cretaceous followed by a Tertiary one. While the former is related to the closure of an embayment of the Meliata ocean into Apulia, the latter is due to the closure of the Alpine Tethys between Apulia and Europe. The along-strike changes in the overall architecture, as for example revealed by geophysical-geological transects, are by far more substantial than hitherto believed. It appears that the Alps are still far from being over-investigated, as is demonstrated by many surprising recent findings based on field geology, laboratory results and geophysical methods of deep sounding.},

abstract = {Reconstructions of the Tethyan realm have been a matter of debate for a long time. Controversies spring usually from a lack of well constrained geological data which can be interpreted in different ways, or, from a lack of constraints on the plate tectonics framework. The western Alps region tends to escape these shortcomings due to a wealth of geological data regarding for examples the rifting and spreading of the Alpine Tethys and its closure, the formation of the Alpine orogenic wedge and accompanying foreland basins, through precise datation of these many events. The larger plate tectonic framework is also well constrained through precise positioning, at least since the Jurassic, of the main plates surrounding the western Alpine Tethys domain, such as the European and African plates, but also the Iberic and Adria micro-plates and the Alboran fragments. Therefore, the Western Alps and surrounding regions represent a key-stone for the western Tethys reconstruction. A detail account of the geological evolution along a western Swiss Alps transect is presented here and confronted to the plate tectonic models derived from a larger western Tethys data base.},

A Greater Apulia domain existed in Mesozoic times, including the autochthonous units of Greece and SW Turkey. It also included a united Adria and Apulia microplate since Early Jurassic times. This key information implies that a new post-Variscan continental fit for the western Tethyan area is necessary, where the relationships between the Adriatic, Apulian and Iberian plates are defined with greater confidence. To construct a reliable palinspastic model of the Alpine realm, plate tectonic constraints must be taken into consideration in order to assess the magnitude of lateral displacements. For most of the plates and their different terranes, differential transport on the scale of thousands of kilometres can be demonstrated. This plate tectonic framework allows a better geodynamic scenario for the formation of the Alpine chain to be proposed, where the western and eastern transects have experienced contrasting geological evolutions. The eastern Alps–Carpathians domain evolved from the north-directed roll-back of the Maliac–Meliata slab and translation of the Meliata suture and Austroalpine domain into the Alpine domain. In the western Alps, the changing African plate boundary in space and time defined the interaction between the Iberian–Brian{\c{c}}onnais plate and the Austroalpine accretionary wedge.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the general features of Mesozoic and Tertiary rock sequences and paleogeography in the Alps. It seeks to outline the paleotectonic significance of the rocks and to discuss the structural evolution of the Alpine geosyncline up to the main deformation, with special reference to the sector between the rivers Rhine and Durance. Accent is placed on the relative independence of Alpine structures involving the pre-Triassic basement rocks and of cover nappes consisting only of Mesozoic and Tertiary formations. Normal shallow-water deposits of platform or miogeosynclinal type were laid down over the whole area before eugeosynclinal conditions set in. The typical eugeosynclinal sediments in the central, Penninic belt of the Alps are the Schistes lustr{\'{e}}s and B{\"{u}}ndnerschiefer, with sills and submarine lava flows of basic volcanic rocks (ophiolites). Before metamorphism they consisted mainly of shales and of impure arenaceous and argillaceous limestones. The bathymetric environment of radiolarian cherts and associated rocks is examined, and their deep-water origin is upheld for the Alpine occurrences. Marine polygenic breccias are characteristic of geosynclinal slopes (commonly fault scarps) and not of a particular depth zone. The Alpine Flysch is a particularly significant sediment. Flysch is a thick marine deposit of predominantly detrital rocks, in part turbidites, generally without volcanic rocks, and laid down during compressional deformation of the geosyncline. Of the many different kinds of Flysch some represent transitions to either B{\"{u}}ndnerschiefer or Molasse. Essential differences between the early synorogenic Flysch and the later synorogenic to post-orogenic Molasse are listed. Argand's stimulating embryotectonic theory of the evolution of the geosyncline is outlined and rejected. The Triassic corresponds to a neutral interval, between the Hercynian and Alpine cycles. Early Alpine geosynclinal history was characterized by vertical or tensional movements along normal faults that limited narrow platforms and rapidly subsiding troughs. This tensional deformation weakened in the Late Jurassic, whereupon bottom relief diminished, and "para-oceanic" conditions prevailed over a large part of the Mediterranean realm. New linear welts of compressional origin arose during the Cretaceous and developed into steep island chains limiting the Flysch basins. Gradually the central part of the Alps rose above sea level, and the geosyncline migrated to the north and west. Here it was finally filled and gave way to the foreland trough in which the Molasse was laid down. There is no simple, direct, genetic and space relationship between Hercynian structures, fault-bordered platforms and troughs of the earlier geosynclinal phase, island chains and basins of the Flysch phase, and the later nappe structures. Paleogeographical features are commonly short-lived and migratory.},

abstract = {Flysch sediments in the Alps are of Early Cretaceous to Late Eocene age. Their deposition cincided in time with alpine orogenesis. However, terrigeneous material was not only derived from the progressing orogenic front and from intrabasinal strucutral highs, but also from the "passive" European margin. This fact is explained by the inversion of the European marginal platforms and basins of Tethys up from the beginning of the orogenesis in the Cretaceous.},

@article{Winkler1984,
abstract = {The Late Maastrichtian to Middle Eocene Gurnigel-Schlieren Flysch is analysed from the point of view of tectonic control on deposition. Facies show an alternation of abyssal plain/oceanic slope, trench fill channellized and non-channellized sediments and finally lower slope deposits. The facies evolution points to a sporadically active subduction trench environment. A detailed picture of the sediment dispersal pattern is deduced from framework-grain analysis, feldspar and lithic fragment counts and conglomerate analysis on current oriented samples. This picture includes 10 major and 3 minor depositional systems which varied in time and space. Variation was influenced by tectonic movements in the basin and source areas, and by sea-level changes. Smoothing out of late Alpine deformation reveals a west-east trending elongated basin geometry and sediment distribution pattern. Flow directions which do not fit with the model are discussed: the Eocene subduction-related rotation of parts of the basin is suggested to have disrupted an initially coherent flow pattern. The sequence was deposited within a remnant of the South Penninic Ligurian ocean, in a trench environment bordered by a continental margin arc.},
