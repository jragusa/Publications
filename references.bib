abstract = {The Chablais Prealps (Haute-Savoie, France) represent a well-preserved accretionary wedge of the Western Alpine Tethys. They comprise a stack of sedimentary nappes related to palaeogeographic realms ranging from the Ultrahelvetic to the Southern Penninic. The provenance analysis is based on the Gazzi-Dickinson method, and on QEMSCAN{\textregistered} for heavy-minerals. The Quartzose petrofacies is the most important of the two sources, and supplied three of the four formations of the Voirons Flysch. It is similar to the sources that fed the other flyschs from the Gurnigel nappe. It is characterised by a mature, quartz-rich assemblage and a heavy mineral population dominated by apatite and the zircon-tourmaline-rutile mineral group. These observations suggest a Clastic wedge provenance. The Feldspathic petrofacies is derived from a feldspar-rich source associated with metamorphic clasts and a heavy mineral population dominated by garnet. This provenance characterises only one formation of the Voirons Flysch, and is related to the Axial Belt provenance. This provenance analysis shows that the Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene Voirons Flysch was fed by two sources, in contrast to the other flyschs of the Gurnigel nappe, and further suggests that this flysch was not deposited in the Piemont Ocean but in the Valais domain. Based on the results and comparative provenance analysis with the other flyschs of the Gurnigel nappe, we propose a generic feeding model which involves the Sesia-Dent Blanche nappe, the sedimentary nappes incorporated in the accretionary prism, and probably the Brian{\c{c}}onnais basement.},

abstract = {The ages obtained from planktonic foraminiferal assemblages retrieved from two exposures in the Gurnigel Flysch and from the re-examination of similar material gathered by previous researchers from the Voirons Flysch reveal only minor discrepancies with previous studies based on nannofossil biostratigraphy. In contrast, major divergences between this work and previous studies on the Voirons Flysch also based on planktonic foraminifera have been identified. They are generally related to distinct approaches in species classification and the use of different zonal schemes. Based on our data, the age of the Voirons Flysch extends from the Early Eocene (planktonic foraminiferal zone P7) to the Middle Eocene (planktonic foraminiferal zone P12). Contrasting with claims made in earlier studies, no specimen of Late Eocene or Early Oligocene age has been observed in the revised material. However, we cannot exclude a younger age (possibly Late Eocene) for the upper portion of this flysch from which we did not revise any sample. Thus, more research and sampling are needed to resolve this question. The palaeogeographic origin of the Voirons-W{\"{a}}gital complex as well as the sedimentation history of these flyschs need now to be re-evaluated in light of this revised biostratigraphic data.},

@article{Ragusa2018b,
abstract = {Grain-size control is frequently invoked to explain the compositional variation of detrital sediments in fluvial sediments. A similar possibility is here investigated in the fossil deep-sea gravity-flow deposits from the Voirons Flysch (Voirons-W{\"{a}}gital complex, Chablais Prealps). About 270 samples of diverse depositional settings were analysed using the framework composition, including cement and porosity, Mutti facies and grain-size measure- ments. Six lithofacies have been identified from cluster analysis. They correspond to channel (L1 to L3) and lobe (L4 and L5) depositional settings and to reworked turbidites (L6). Our results emphasize the close relationship between petrography and grain-size which alters the detrital signal from extrabasinal sources. The abundant polycrystalline component of proximal deposits is progressively removed while skeletal grains and additional intrabasinal grains become more abundant in distal deposits. Alongside, porosity is reduced by the simultaneous increase ofcement which constrains subsequent diagenetic modifications. Hence, proximal depositional settings keep most of the inherited signal from extrabasinal sources whereas distal deposits will be homogenised. When plotted in provenance-analysis diagrams, the successive depositional settings show distinct fields possibly corresponding to different tectonic settings of the Dickinson model. This compositional variation thus creates a bias in provenance interpretation resulting fromboth grain-size control andflowmechanisms. Finally, our results emphasize that petrographic datamust be handledwith care in provenance analyses, especiallywhen comparing various deep-sea gravity flow systems with different grain-size ranges.},
