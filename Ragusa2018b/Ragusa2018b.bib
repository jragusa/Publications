abstract = {A reliable interpretation of glaucony-bearing units requires the characterization of compositional, spatial, and temporal attributes of glaucony. The criteria that can readily determine the differentiation of the various types of glaucony (autochthonous, parautochthonous or allochthonous intrasequential, and detrital or allochthonous extrasequential) are discussed in detail. Autochthonous vs allochthonous glaucony may be often detected on the basis of detailed sedimentological investigations, including facies interpretation of glaucony-bearing deposits and careful examination of spatial distribution of glaucony. Textural and morphological features, although generally not diagnostic on their own, provide a significant contribution to glaucony interpretation. The distinction between parautochthonous and detrital glaucony can be sometimes performed by radiometric dating; more commonly, it requires that compositional attributes of glaucony be matched against those of putative sources. Glauconies from distinct parent rocks generally have different maturity and carry unique geochemical and mineralogical fingerprints that may contribute definitive data for provenance research. Previous work on glaucony and examples from units formed in tectonically stable areas (Cretaceous/Eocene deposits of Paris Basin and Hampshire Basin) and active tectonic basin settings (Miocene strata of southern Alps and northern Apennines) provide the opportunity to discuss the validity of the proposed criteria across different structural domains and emphasize the need for an integrated approach to the study of glaucony.},

abstract = {Detailed analysis of recent literature on glaucony and selected case studies (Eocene, Isle of Wight; Miocene, northern Apennines) shows that the presence of glaucony alone is not diagnostic of a specific systems tract of a depositional sequence. A reliable sequence stratigraphic interpretation of glaucony-bearing units requires additional information on glaucony, including: (1) spatial distribution, (2) maturity (distinction between nascent, slightly evolved, evolved, and highly evolved glaucony), and (3) genetic attributes (differentiation of autochtonous from allochthonous, and intrasequential from extrasequential glaucony). Autochthonous glaucony is common at various stratigraphic levels in the transgressive systems tract (TST) and the lower highstand systems tract (HST), showing an upward increase (TST) and then decrease (HST) in abundance and maturity. The condensed section can be distinguished from the overlying and underlying deposits by the higher concentration and maturity of glaucony. Allochthonous intrasequential ( parautochthonous ) glaucony can be present in the entire TST, HST, and lowstand systems tract (LST), generally showing lower concentration and maturity than its autochthonous counterpart. Allochthonous extrasequential ( detrital ) glaucony is present mainly in the LST, its concentration and composition depending on the characteristics of the source horizon. The association between autochthonous and allochthonous (intrasequential and extrasequential) glaucony commonly exists in the LST and in the lower TST.},

abstract = {Sand composition of arenite successions is sensitive to a suite of factors operating between initial grain production and final diagenesis on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Seven allogenic factors, the relative importance of which relies upon the complex interaction between tectonics, eustasy, and climate, play a decisive role in dictating petrofacies distribution within siliciclastic to hybrid depositional sequences. These factors include (i) tectonic exhumation, (ii) physical and chemical rock breakdown, (iii) change in sediment flux, (iv) change in source/basin physiography, (v) shelf colonization by organisms, (vi) generation of chemical grains, and (vii) volcanism. Autogenic processes may locally have a considerable influence on the type and amount of sediment supplied to the basin, thus interfering with the external control. Based upon literature data, a conceptual framework of expected compositional changes across the key surfaces for sequence-stratigraphic interpretation is outlined. Two case histories, from the Miocene shelf-to-turbidite deposits of the northern Apennines and the Quaternary alluvial-to-nearshore succession of the Adriatic coast, respectively, are used as references to illustrate how arenite petrofacies changes can be framed into a sequence-stratigraphic scheme on multiple timescales.},

abstract = {This study presents a review on palaeogeographic implications and temporal variations of glaucony covering both modern and ancient records. Phanerozoic glaucony preferably forms in a shelf depositional setting. Deep marine conditions and low seawater temperature discourage formation of glaucony. Around 75{\%} of glaucony is recorded from the Cretaceous to the Holo- cene sediments, which are related to the abundance of the most common substrates, faecal pellets and bioclasts. TFe 2O3 (total), Al2O3, K2O and MgO contents of glaucony vary appreciably through geological time. While TFe2O3 content of most Mesozoic and Cenozoic glaucony ex- ceeds 20{\%}, it is always less than 20{\%} in Precambrian varieties. High K2O, Al2 O 3, MgO and low TFe2O3 distinguish the Precambrian glaucony from its Phanerozoic counterpart. Precambrian glaucony, preferably formed within a K-feldspar substrate, is always rich in potassium irre- spective of its degree of evolution, while high K-content in Phanerozoic evolved glaucony in- dicates significant stratigraphic condensation. K 2O vs. TFe2O3 relationship of glaucony exhibits three different evolutionary trends corresponding to three common modes of origin. Deposi- tional conditions may influence the composition of glaucony as slightly reducing conditions favour Fe enrichment, whereas oxidising conditions cause Fe depletion in glaucony.

abstract = {Calcite cementation within shallow marine sandstones typically occurs as (1) continuously cemented layers, (2) layers of concretions, and (3) concretions scattered throughout the sandstone. This paper presents a model for the nucleation and diffusion-controlled growth of calcite cement which explains how these three types of calcite cementation arise by diagenetic redistribution of carbonate fossils originally contained within the sandstones. The model predicts that nucleation points in a system where clastic carbonate is concentrated in layers, will be confined to these layers, and a continuously cemented layer or a layer of stratabound concretions will form from the carbonate fossil-rich layer depending upon the original amount of clastic carbonate present within the layer. The semi-regular distance observed between stratabound concretions is a result of each nucleation point lowering the concentration of dissolved calcite in the surrounding sandstone and thereby inhibiting nucleation in close proximity to earlier formed nuclei. In a system with a homogeneous distribution of clastic carbonate, no preferred levels of nucleation are present, and this explains how a uniform three-dimensional distribution of concretions may arise. Flattening of concretions parallel to bedding is a natural consequence of diffusion-controlled growth in a system where the clastic carbonate is concentrated in layers, and need not have anything to do with permeability anisotropy. Formation of continuous calcite cemented layers by merging of concretions explains why closely spaced vertical geochemical profiles through a calcite cemented layer often are widely different.},

abstract = {The synthesis of mudstone petrology and interbedded sandstone detrital zircon geochronology provides insights into the provenance, weathering regime, hydrodynamic effects, and diagenesis of the Mesoproterozoic Unkar Group. Unkar mudstones were derived largely from the Grenville Orogen (GO) of southwest Texas and the adjacent Yavapai–Mazatzal (YM) and Southern Granite Rhyolite (SGR) terranes. Detrital zircon data indicate distinct pulses of GO-derived sediment during Hakatai and Dox Formation deposition whereas Shinumo sediment contains a larger component of YM and SGR material. An increase in plagioclase and biotite abundances in the Dox further suggest an orogenic pulse. Bulk chemistry, including elevated Cr and Ni abundances and REE systematics, implicate a heterogeneous provenance for Unkar sediment best approximated by a mix of granite or granodiorite with some basalt. Weathering of Unkar sediment, as determined from mudstone and crystalline-source bulk-chemical trends, is characterized as moderate (CIA values between 55 and 70) indicative of a temperate climate in an orogenic setting. Small (less than 10 wt{\%}) amounts of detrital kaolinite and chlorite are consistent with a moderate (temperate) weathering regime. Illite, the dominant clay mineral in the Unkar Group, is largely the 2M1 polytype and detrital in origin. However, it is estimated that {\~{}} 7{\%} of the K in the Escalante Creek Member results from K-metasomatism and may form up to {\~{}} 15 wt{\%} authigenic 1M or 1Md illite. The clay-size fraction and zircon are the chief contributors to the REE budget in Unkar mudstones. Lithostratigraphic variations in the HREE distributions can be attributed partially to variable zircon abundance in the silt-size fraction, a likely function of hydrodynamic sorting. Age constraints on the duration of Unkar Group sedimentation range from 30 to 100 My for the {\~{}} 1100 m conformable Shinumo–Dox succession and result in compacted sedimentation rates of between 1.0 and 3.6 cm/103 yr. These rates are comparable to Mesozoic foreland-basin settings. GeoRef Subject},

abstract = {Porosity and permeability generally decrease with increasing depth (thermal exposure and effective pressure); however, a significant number of deep ({\textgreater}4 km [approximately 13,000 ft]) sandstone reservoirs worldwide are characterized by anomalously high porosity and permeability. Anomalous porosity and permeability can be defined as being statistically higher than the porosity and permeability values occurring in typical sandstone reservoirs of a given lithology (composition and texture), age, and burial/temperature history. In sandstones containing anomalously high porosities, such porosities exceed the maximum porosity of the typical sandstone subpopulation. Major causes of anomalous porosity and permeability were identified decades ago; however, quantification of the effect of processes responsible for anomalous porosity and permeability and the assessment of the predictability of anomalous porosity and permeability occurrence in subsurface sandstones have rarely been addressed in published literature. The focus of this article is on quantification and predictability of three major causes of anomalously high porosity: (1) grain coats and grain rims, (2) early emplacement of hydrocarbons, and (3) shallow development of fluid overpressure. Grain coats and grain rims retard quartz cementation and concomitant porosity and permeability reduction by inhibiting precipitation of quartz overgrowths on detrital-quartz grains. Currently, prediction of anomalous porosity associated with grain coats and grain rims is dependent on the availability of empirical data sets. In the absence of adequate empirical data, sedimentologic and diagenetic models can be helpful in assessing risk due to reservoir quality. Such models provide a means to evaluate the effect of geologic constraints on coating occurrence and coating completeness required to preserve economically viable porosity and permeability in a given play or prospect. These constraints include thermal history and sandstone grain size and composition. The overall effect of hydrocarbon emplacement on reservoir quality is controversial. It appears that at least some cements (quartz and illite) may continue to precipitate following emplacement of hydrocarbons into the reservoir. Our work indicates that integration of basin modeling with reservoir quality modeling can be used to quantify, prior to drilling, the potential impact of hydrocarbon emplacement on porosity and permeability. The best-case scenario for significant reservoir quality preservation due to fluid overpressure development is in rapidly deposited Tertiary or Quaternary sandstones. Our models suggest that significant porosity can be preserved in sandstones that have experienced continuous high fluid overpressures from shallow burial depths. The models also indicate that the potential for porosity preservation is greatest in ductile-grain-rich sandstones because compaction tends to be the dominant control on reservoir quality in such rocks. The case for significant porosity preservation associated with fluid overpressures in pre-Tertiary basins, however, is more problematic because of the complexities in the history of fluid overpressure and the greater significance of quartz cementation as a potential mechanism of porosity loss.},

abstract = {Grain size analysis is an essential tool for classifying sedimentary environments. The calculation of statistics for many samples can, however, be a laborious process. A computer program called GRADISTAT has been written for the rapid analysis of grain size statistics from any of the standard measuring techniques, such as sieving and laser granulometry. Mean, mode, sorting, skewness and other statistics are calculated arithmetically and geometrically (in metric units) and logarithmically (in phi units) using moment and Folk and Ward graphical methods. Method comparison has allowed Folk and Ward descriptive terms to be assigned to moments statistics. Results indicate that Folk and Ward measures, expressed in metric units, appear to provide the most robust basis for routine comparisons of compositionally variable sediments. The program runs within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet package and is extremely versatile, accepting standard and non-standard size data, and producing a range of graphical outputs including frequency and ternary plots.

abstract = {Recognition of the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary and biohorizons on the continental margin of California is complicated by turbidite deposition. The coiling ratio of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (Ehrenberg), the relative frequencies of subarctic and transitional planktonic foraminifers, radiolarian number, and the radiolarian-foraminiferal ratio all show variability in upper Quaternary sections that appear related to downslope transport processes, in addition to the environment of surface waters and carbonate dissolution. We examined the distribution of microfossils in ten turbidites from the western levee of the Monterey Fan to determine 1) how turbidite microfossil assemblages differ from those of hemipelagic intervals, 2) if turbiditic muds can be distinguished from hemipelagic muds based on fossil content, and 3) if microfossils used to define biostratigraphic zones are significantly affected by turbiditic processes. Using cluster analysis, samples were successfully divided into hemipelagic and turbiditic groups based on the relationship among five of 16 variables (cluster A): sand content, the relative frequency of shallow-water benthonic Foraminifera, benthonic foraminiferal number, adjusted benthonic foraminiferal number, and the relative frequency of dextral Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (Ehrenberg). The variables jointly characterize a transitional assemblage transported from a bathyal or neritic source. Both Radiolaria and planktonic Foraminifera are used to mark biohorizons on the California continental margin. In this study, it was found that both fossil groups vary significantly in concentration and relative frequency between turbiditic and hemipelagic muds of the Monterey Fan, and microfossil assemblages are measurably different between tops and bases of turbidites. The coiling ratio of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (Ehrenberg) varies the least and may be most resistant to bias by hydraulic sorting and differential carbonate preservation related to transport processes.},

abstract = {The palaeogeographic attribution of the Schlieren Flysch and its counterparts in the Gurnigel Nappe is still a matter of debate. These Late Alpine deep-sea trench deposits show a variable tectonic thrust relationship with other nappes inferring either an Ultrahelvetic or South Penninic origin of the elongated trench basin. An improved knowledge of the supplying source terranes of the Schlieren Flysch basin may add to the palaeogeographic ascription. Detrital zircons from seven representative samples have been dated by laser ablation ICP-MS analysis methods. The obtained age patterns are compared with standard provenance analysis methods including modal grain and heavy mineral statistics of the sandstones. The detrital zircons show two major populations of Pan-African (ca. 650–450 Ma) and Variscan (ca. 360–320 Ma) ages. A low abundance of Devonian detrital zircons separates the two main age populations. The Th/U signature of the zircons implies that igneous rocks of these two orogenic cycles directly, or indirectly (by multicyclic reworking of zircons) have strongly contributed to the clastic input. The earlier described bimodal turbiditic supply to the Schlieren Flysch basin is matched by the geochronologic data. With regard to the other petrographic signatures of the sandstones, it becomes evident that the granitic-rhyolitic source terrane derived (K-feldspar bearing) sandstones show a higher abundance of Pan-African zircons and a higher abundance of tourmaline in the heavy mineral fractions. In contrast, the exclusively plagioclase-bearing sandstones from the tonalitic–andesitic source contain a majority of Variscan zircons and higher contents of apatite. In addition, we observe a third minor population comprising Triassic–Early Jurassic detrital zircons. The correlation of the obtained detrital zircon ages with pre-Cretaceous igneous, metamorphic and geodynamic events, which affected the basement of the northern and southern margins of the Alpine Tethys reveals a major difference by the presence of Triassic magmatic products and volcaniclastics in South Alpine and Austroalpine units. The discovery of the minor Triassic–Early Jurassic population in both sandstone types of the Schlieren Flysch would argue for the derivation of the clastic material from the southern Alpine Tethys or Adriatic–Apulian margin.},

abstract = {A multi-proxy approach to understand environmental change in deep time was undertaken on about 150. m of core from a 230. m-long Middle Eocene core from the Ainsa basin, Spanish Pyrenees, representing deep-marine siliciclastic sediments, using detailed sedimentary logging, high-resolution multi-element XRF geochemistry, total organic carbon, and stable carbon isotopes. The Well A6 was drilled, as part of an industry-university consortium, through siltstones, fine-/very fine-grained sandstone turbidites, and hemipelagic structureless mudstones, that were deposited as overbank and off-axis deposits from a sandy submarine fan, and interfan deposits. For comparative mineralogy between the sandstone turbidites and siltstones, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were undertaken on selected samples. The sandstone turbidites show enrichment of detrital elements such as Si, Zr and Ti, that can be linked to greater quartz and heavy-mineral content compared with adjacent siltstones. Structureless hemipelagic mudstones comprise mainly clay minerals and carbonate. We interpret the sandstone turbidites as from hyperpycnal flows during high river sediment discharge, whilst hemipelagic mudstones resulted from the suspension fall-out of hypopycnal flows. Cyclostratigraphic analysis of the core reveals Milankovitch cyclicity at frequencies of {\~{}} 0.03. cycles/m (short eccentricity), {\~{}} 0.09 cycles/m (obliquity), {\~{}} 0.15 cycles/m (precession couplet) and {\~{}} 0.19 cycles/m (precession couplet). Orbital parameters appear to have controlled the cyclic delivery of coarser-grained sediment by turbidity currents. Two equally plausible depositional models, both as Milankovitch-driven, can explain the cyclical changes in the deep-marine sediments: (1) climatic cycles, with humid periods of enhanced chemical weathering, increased storminess and greater riverine run-off, leading to high sediment flux to the deep basin as sandstone turbidites; (2) climatic cycles, with cooler conditions linked to high-frequency small-scale eustatic sea-level fluctuations, with lowstand shelf-edge delta progradation, resulting in greater volumes of coarse detrital sediment to the seafloor by hyperpycnal flows. This study provides an insight into the likely depositional effects of orbitally-induced climate change on the nature and delivery of terrigenous sediment into deep-marine environments.},

abstract = {The flysch sequences of the Swiss Prealps (Alpine front ranges) are described and interpreted in the light of a decade of study by a group research project at Fribourg. The geographical and geological settings are illustrated. The stratigraphy and sedimentology, the sedimentary petrography and the geodynamic setting are discussed. Correlations within and outside the Prealps, as well as outstanding problems, are treated. The flysch units and sequences covered are the Gurnigel Flysch, the M{\'{e}}dianes Flysch, Helminthoid Flysch, Fouyet, Manche and Mocausa Flysch, Hundsr{\"{u}}ck Flysch, Niesen Flysch and the Ultrahelvetic Flysch. The data from clast, framework-grain and heavy mineral analysis, from micropalaeontology, from facies analysis, palaeocurrent measurements and stratigraphy allow the interpretation of sedimentary environments, source terranes and depositional models. In all cases, flysch deposits are deep marine detrital accumulations and source areas were undergoing active tectonics. Individual models are based on the deep-sea fan concept, but interpretations tend to show significant modifications with respect to simple fan characteristics. These departures are to some extent due to available grain size, to active structuring of basins or to minor controls such as eustatic variations or climatic influence. The integration of sedimentological data with stratigraphy and regional structure furnishes palinspastic reconstructions in map view. These provide insights on the palaeogeography of the Western Alps from Mid-Cretaceous to Oligocene and give a picture of the evolution of the Western Mediterranean Tethys during the same period. The relationship between flysch deposition and alpine mountain building is confirmed, while constraints on basin evolution are established.},

abstract = {Supercritical-flow phenomena are fairly common in modern sedimentary envi- ronments, yet their recognition and analysis remain difficult in the strati- graphic record. This fact is commonly ascribed to the poor preservation potential of deposits from high-energy supercritical flows. However, the num- ber of flume data sets on supercritical-flow dynamics and sedimentary struc- tures is very limited in comparison with available data for subcritical flows, which hampers the recognition and interpretation of such deposits. The results of systematic flume experiments spanning a broad range of supercriti- cal-flow bedforms (antidunes, chutes-and-pools and cyclic steps) developed in mobile sand beds of variable grain sizes are presented. Flow character and related bedform patterns are constrained through time-series measurements of bed configurations, flow depths, flow velocities and Froude numbers. The results allow the refinement and extension of some widely used bedform sta- bility diagrams in the supercritical-flow domain, clarifying in particular the morphodynamic relations between antidunes and cyclic steps. The onset of antidunes is controlled by flows exceeding a threshold Froude number. The transition from antidunes to cyclic steps in fine to medium-grained sand occurs at a threshold mobility parameter. Sedimentary structures associated with supercritical bedforms developed under variable aggradation rates are revealed by means of combining flume results and synthetic stratigraphy. The sedimentary structures are compared with examples from field and other flume studies. Aggradation rate is seen to exert an important control on the geometry of supercritical-flow structures and should be considered when identifying supercritical bedforms in the sedimentary record.},

abstract = {Distinct heavy mineral accumulations, named here as heavy mineral shadows, were observed on a current, lineated bedding plane in the quartzose Whirlpool Sandstone (Silurian) near Georgetown, Ontario. The shadows are irregular in form but show one consistent feature: in plan, along lines parallel to the current lineation, one side of a shadow is defined by an abrupt boundary between the heavy mineral-rich (dark) area and adjacent quartz-rich (light) area, while the other side is characterized by a gradual transition into the light area. Comparison with paleocurrent directions determined from nearby sedimentary structures and with grain imbrication a few millimeters below the bedding plane on which they occur, indicates that the paleoflow was from the quartz-rich areas towards th sharply defined side of the heavy mineral shadows. A set of flume experiments was undertaken with a mixture of 97{\%} (by weight) quartz sand and 3{\%} chromite sand as the bed material. Stream power during each run was within the range of upper-flow regime plane-bed stability. With increasing stream power, the chromite sand behaved as follows: (1) heavy mineral shadows were stable, identical in form to those described above moving, intermittently beneath a "streaky," faster-moving quartz-sand bed load; (2) shadows were completely destroyed, and the chromite sand formed a diffuse layer beneath the quartz sand in transport; and (3) chromite sand was concentrated across the crests of very low standing-wave bed forms with wavelengths of 0.4 m and amplitudes as small as 1.5 min. Although the data available is too limited to allow anything more than speculation on their origin, the recognition of heavy mineral shadows provides a new tool for paleocurrent studies. Flume experiments also suggest that its presence on bedding planes may have paleohydraulic implications.},

@incollection{Dickinson1974,
abstract = {The theory of plate tectonics offers a fresh opportunity to interpret the evolution of sedimentary basins in terms of changing plate interactions and shifting plate junctures. Although plate-tectonic theory lays primary emphasis on horizontal movements of the lithosphere, large vertical movements are also implied in response to changes in the thickness of crust, in the thermal condition of lithosphere, and in the isostatic balance of lithosphere over asthenosphere. As thick sedimentation requires either an initial depression or progressive subsidence to proceed, the auxiliary vertical movements largely control the evolution of sedimentary basins. Ancillary geographic changes related to the governing horizontal movements also affect patterns of sedimentation strongly. The geosynclinal terminology used prior to the advent of plate tectonics is inadequate to describe fully the plate-tectonic settings of sedimentary basins. Basins can be described instead in terms of the type of substratum beneath the basin, the proximity of the basin to a plate margin, and the type of plate juncture nearest to the basin. Intraplate settings of oceanic or continental character contrast with zones of plate interaction, which include those of divergent, convergent, and transform motions and within each of which the underlying crustal structure is or may be complex. The evolution of a sedimentary basin thus can be viewed as the result of a succession of discrete plate-tectonic settings and plate interactions whose effects blend into a continuum of development. Oceanic basins contain an assemblage of diachronous facies whose relations are controlled by thermal subsidence of the lithosphere as it moves away from midoceanic rises. Rifted continental margins undergo successive stages of structural evolution as the following features are formed: prerift arch, rift valley, proto-oceanic gulf, narrow ocean, and open ocean. Sedimentary phases related to each stage are components of the rifted-margin prism of strata that masks the continent-ocean interface beneath a continental terrace-slope-rise association or a progradational continental embankment. Marginal fracture ridges along marginal offsets and aulacogens along failed arms of triple junctions locally break the continuity of rifted-margin prisms. Sedimentary basins associated with arc-trench systems where oceanic lithosphere is consumed include trenches beyond the subduction complex beneath the trench slope break, forearc basins in the arc-trench gap, intra-arc basins within the magmatic arc, and interarc basins or retroarc basins in the backarc area. Interarc basins are oceanic basins between a migratory intraoceanic arc and a remnant arc, whereas retroarc basins rest on continental basement adjacent to a foreland fold-thrust belt behind a continental margin arc. Peripheral basins adjacent to suture belts formed by crustal collision occur in an analogous foreland setting between orogen and craton, but in front of a colliding magmatic arc. Retroarc basins and peripheral basins both imply partial subduction of continental lithosphere. Intracontinental basins include infra-continental types, beneath which incipient continental separation gave rise to crust of transitional thickness, as well as supracontinental types.},

abstract = {Detrital modes of sandstone suites primarily reflect the different tectonic settings of provenance terranes, although various other sedimentological factors also influence sandstone compositions. Comparisons of sandstone compositions are aided by grouping diverse grain types into a few operational categories having broad genetic significance. Compositional fields associated with different provenances can then be displayed on standard triangular diagrams. The major provenance types related to continental sources are stable cratons, basement uplifts, magmatic arcs, and recycled orogens. Each provenance type contributes distinctive detritus preferentially to associated sedimentary basins that occupy a limited number of characteristic tectonic settings in each case. Sands of composite provenance can be described as mixtures of quartzose sand from stable cratons, quartzofeldspathic sand from basement uplifts or arc plutons, feldspatholithic sand from arc volcanics, and quartzolithic sands of several types from different kinds of recycled orogens that yield varying proportions of quartzose and lithic grains. Proportions of contributions from different provenance types can be estimated from mean compositions for ideal derivative sands represented by points or restricted areas on triangular plots. Evolutionary trends in sandstone composition within individual basins or sedimentary provinces commonly reflect changes in tectonic setting through time, or erosional modification of provenance terranes. Forearc sandstone suites typically evolve from feldspatholitic petrofacies of volcaniclastic nature, through lithofeldspathic petrofacies of volcanoplutonic origin, to quartzofeldspathic petrofacies of plutonic derivation. Foreland sandstone suites commonly evolve from rift-related quartzofeldspathic petrofacies, through quartzose petrofacies of passive continental margins, to quartzolithic petrofacies derived from recycled orogens.},

abstract = {The determination of detrital modes in graywackes and arkoses, here grouped as subquartzose sandstones, requires special attention to the identification of detrital grain types, as defined operationally, and to the recognition of detrital textures, as opposed to textural elements of diagenetic origin. Accurate detrital modes can yield specific information on provenance that can be gained in no other way. Reserving the terms graywacke and arkose for imprecise field descriptions and abandoning the proportion of matrix as a prime means of classification, subquartzose sandstones can be described adequately using six numerical grain parameters. Three primary parameters summing to 100 permit quantitative serial designation of rock types in the form Q x F y L z , where Q is total quartzose grains, F is total feldspar grains, and L is total unstable lithic fragments in the framework. Three secondary parameters in the form of ratios permit desirable refinement within each primary parameter: C/Q where C is total polycrystalline quartzose grains, P/F where P is total plagioclase grains, and V/L where V is total volcanic lithic grains. Stable grains, whose sum is the parameter Q, are essentially pure silica in mineralogy, and include both monacrystalline quartz and polycrystalline lithic fragments. The latter are gradational to less quartzose types and difficult to distinguish from felsite grains, which display relict textures of volcanic origin and internal relief owing to their polyminerallic nature. Lithic fragments are subdivided at two levels into four main categories within which are various subcategories: (a) volcanic fragments include felsitic, microlitic, lathwork, and vitric types; (b) clastic fragments include silty-sandy and argillaceous types; (c) tectonite fragments include metasedimentary quartzose types and metavolcanic feldspathic or ferromagnesian types; and (d) microgranular fragments include hypabyssal, hornfelsic, and indurated sedimentary types. Interstitial materials include (a) exotic cements like calcite or zeolite; (b) homogeneous, monominerallic phyllosilicate cement displaying textures indicative of porefilling; (c) clayey detrital lutum called protomatrix; (d) recrystallized lutum or protomatrix called orthomatrix with relict detrital texture (e) murky, polyminerallic, diagenetic pore-filling called epimatrix, whose growth is accompanied by alteration of framework grains; and (f) deformed and recrystallized lithic fragments called pseudomatrix. Extensive albitization and other alterations complicate the interpretation of detrital modes in many rocks, but potential errors commonly can be avoided by close attention to mineralogy and relict texture except where tectonite fabrics disrupt or transpose the original detrital framework. Most subquartzose sandstones were derived from one. or a mixture, of three salient provenance types: (a) volcanic terranes, yielding feldspatholithic rocks nearly free of quartz, (b) plutonic terranes, yielding feldspathic rocks with few lithic fragments, and (c) uplifted sedimentary and metasedimentary "tectonic" terranes, yielding "chert-grain" lithic rocks with few quartz and feldspar grains except where recycled volcanic or plutonic detritus is abundant. Many voluminous accumulations of subquartzose sandstones near continental margins had as their provenance complex volcano-plutonic orogens representing ancient magmatic arcs analogous to modern arcs associated with trenches.},

abstract = {The Great Valley Sequence of Upper Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous strata is composed of clastic detritus eroded from the Sierran-Klamath belt, which was the site of a late Mesozoic magmatic arc. The sequence accumulated mainly as a prismatic wedge of turbidites in an asymmetric trough within the arc-trench gap. Stratigraphic variations in detrital sandstone mineralogy define five petrologic intervals, or nearly synchronous petrofacies, useful for regional correlation. By contrast, local lithofacies are markedly lenticular. The clastic debris in the sequence was derived mainly from volcanic and plutonic rocks in varying proportions. The parameters used to define the petrofacies include: (a) content of quartzose grains (Q), feldspar grains (F), and unstable lithic fragments (L) expressed as volumetric percentages of the Q-F-L population; (b) ratios of plagioclase to total feldspar (P/F) and volcanic rock fragments to total unstable lithic fragments (V/L), and (c) content of mica (M) expressed as volumetric percentage of framework sand grains. The most distinctive characteristics of the petrofacies recognized, and their approximate time-stratigraphic spans, are as follows: (1) Stony Creek (Tithonian-Neocomian): quartz-poor and feldspatholithic sandstones with high P/F, high V/L, low M; (2) Lodoga (Aptian-Albian): quartz-rich sandstones with high P/F; (3) Boxer (Cenomanian): two distinct variants with moderate P/F, one quartz-rich and the other quartz-poor and feldspatholithic; (4) Cortina (Turonian-Coniacian): two similar variants with moderate P/F, one with Q-F-L proportions nearly equal and the other quartz-poor and feld-spatholithic; (5) Rumsey (Santonian-Campanian): quartz-rich lithofeldspathic with low P/F and high M. The nature of the petrofacies and their age can be related to the petrology and timing of dated intrusive episodes with inferred volcanic accompaniments in the Sierra Nevada. The Stony Creek petrofacies contains mainly volcanic debris erupted during the Yosemite magmatic epoch, and the overlying Lodoga petrofacies contains mainly plutonic debris emplaced during the same epoch, but only exposed to erosion by subsequent dissection. The Boxer and Cortina petrofacies contain mixed and intercalated volcanic and plutonic debris derived mainly from rocks erupted or emplaced during the Huntington Lake magmatic epoch. The slight differences between the Boxer and Cortina petrofacies may indicate that plutonic contributions were partly from older rocks for the Boxer, but volcanic contributions were essentially the same for both. The Rumsey facies contains mainly plutonic debris, with subordinate volcanic debris, derived from igneous rocks of the Cathedral Range magmatic epoch. Except locally or slightly, petrofacies boundaries do not transgress time-stratigraphic boundaries in the region. A close linkage among major magmatic, tectonic, and depositional events in arc-trench systems is implied.},

abstract = {Detrital framework modes of sandstone suites from different kinds of basins are a function of provenance types governed by plate tectonics. Quartzose sands from continental cratons are widespread within interior basins, platform successions, miogeoclinal wedges, and opening ocean basins. Arkosic sands from uplifted basement blocks are present locally in rift troughs and in wrench basins related to transform ruptures. Volcaniclastic lithic sands and more complex volcano-plutonic sands derived from magmatic arcs are present in trenches, forearc basins, and marginal seas. Recycled orogenic sands, rich in quartz or chert plus other lithic fragments and derived from subduction complexes, collision orogens, and foreland uplifts, are present in closing ocean basins, diverse succ ssor basins, and foreland basins. Triangular diagrams showing framework proportions of quartz, the two feldspars, polycrystalline quartzose lithics, and unstable lithics of volcanic and sedimentary parentage successfully distinguish the key provenance types. Relations between provenance and basin are important for hydrocarbon exploration because sand frameworks of contrasting detrital compositions respond differently to diagenesis, and thus display different trends of porosity reduction with depth of burial.},

Mica in the very fine to fine-sand sizes has been traditionally used by sedimen- to]ogists to delineate areas of deposition or nondeposition and potential winnowing of fines, and is here found to be the hydraulic equivalent of silt-sized particles but not of clay. Experiments also showed that mica flakes tend to settle at orientations which are neither perpendicular nor parallel to the gravitational vector and tend to generally maintain their orientation throughout. Equations for the settling of a disc in Lerman and others (1974) and that developed by Komar and Reimers (1978) are shown to be mathematically similar for the coarse-silt to fine-sand ranges of discs and are adequate predictors of settling rates of mica flakes. A comparison of the hydraulic equivalency of quartz spheres to coarse-silt- through fine-sand-sized mica flakes is presented. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Reservoir quality is a critical risk factor in deep to ultradeep reservoirs at depths {\textgreater}4.5 km. Analysis of Paleogene Wilcox sandstones on the upper Texas Gulf Coast provides insight into the evolution of reservoir quality during shallow to ultradeep burial diagenesis. Reduction of porosity and permeability with burial in Wilcox sandstones was evaluated using subsurface samples from 200 to 6700 m, at temperatures of 25–230 °C. Diagenesis and petrophysical properties were interpreted from petrographic data and core analyses. Wilcox sandstones are mostly lithic arkoses and feldspathic litharenites having an average composition of Q59F22R19. Provenance did not change significantly during Wilcox deposition in this area, nor does average sandstone composition vary among lower, middle, and upper Wilcox sandstones. However, composition does vary with sequence-stratigraphic position; lowstand slope-fan deposits contain more rock fragments than do deposits from highstand or transgressive systems tracts. Given observations from this onshore dataset, Wilcox sandstones deposited in deepwater environments in the Gulf of Mexico are likely to contain more rock fragments than their linked highstand equivalents. Pore types in Wilcox sandstones change from a mix of primary and secondary pores and micropores at shallower depths to predominantly secondary pores and micropores in deeper sandstones. Wilcox sandstones show steady porosity reduction from an average of 33{\%} at 38 °C to 12{\%} at 132 °C, with little additional loss at higher temperatures. By 132 °C, most primary pores have been lost by mechanical compaction or occluded by quartz cementation. Volume of secondary pores remains nearly constant despite dissolution of 3.5{\%} average potassium feldspar during deep burial. Volume of this late dissolution of potassium feldspar is offset by precipitation of ankerite, albite, illite, and minor quartz in secondary pores. The proportion of microporosity, which occurs in authigenic clays, altered grains, and matrix, increases in the deepest sandstones. Change in proportion of pore types and reduction in total porosity with increasing temperature changes porosity–permeability transforms. Because most deep to ultradeep Wilcox sandstones are dominated by secondary pores and micropores, porosity–permeability transforms have lower slopes than those for shallower sandstones.},

abstract = {Using a detailed petrographical procedure conceived for arenites rich in carbonate clasts, the influence of tectonism and eustacy on silicate/carbonate cycles of the Eocene Hecho Turbidite Complex has been tested, and the palaeogeography of the source/basin system outlined. Both extrabasinal and intrabasinal sources of sediments were active during basin filling. The extrabasinal source terrains, located in the southern sector of the basin, were made of the Pyrenean crystalline basement (granites, gneisses and phyllites) overlain mainly by carbonate rocks (Cretaceous limestones and dolostones, minor chert and siltstones). The intrabasinal sources, represented by foramol shelf carbonate factories, provided penecontemporaneous carbonate bioclasts, intraclasts and peloidal grains. Foreland thrusting in the South-Central Pyrenees has acted as the major control on the composition and architecture of the Hecho Turbidite Complex. Strong uplift of old silicate and carbonate source terrains during southward thrust propagation was responsible for erosion, swamping and/or reduction of shelfal areas, and gave rise to siliciclastic and carbonate basinal sequences (silicate arenites and calclithites) during lowstand stages. Conversely, hybrid arenites (mixture of extrabasinal and intrabasinal grains) originated from resedimentation of marginal shelf sediments produced in carbonate factories active during the initial phase of sea-level rise. Hybrid arenites with minor intrabasinal content also formed during one stage of relative sea-level fall from the erosion of previously accumulated highstand complexes. During resedimentation processes, hybrid sands underwent marked hydraulic selection documented by deposits depleted in carbonate grains in the channel area, and by thin-bedded turbidites rich in platy-skeletal fragments, low-density peloids and void-rich bioclasts down-basin.},

abstract = {The sieving methods presently in use for loosely consolidated rocks are inadequate for the determination of grain-size distribution in cemented and indurated sedimentary rocks. Thin-section study represents an alternative method of obtaining the particle size distribution for such rocks. The purpose of this study is to establish a correlation between sieve and thin-section grain-size analyses. Grain-size analyses were made on thirty-eight rock samples by both sieving and thin-section methods. The cumulative frequency curve determined from the apparent long diameter measured in thin-section lies toward the coarser size range with respect to the sieve-size distribution curve, but the discrepancy between the cumulative frequency curves for the two techniques is small. A plot of thin-section quartile parameters against sieving quartile parameters indicates a linear correlation between the two techniques. For all practical purposes, the same linear function expresses the relationship between quartile parameters as determined by the two methods, so that all three quartile measures (Ql, Md, Q3) can be combined into one plot. A graph based on 114 quartile measures for sieve and thin-section analyses forms the basis for the derivation of sieve-size dis tribution from thin-section data. A new graph paper has been developed which permits the construction of a cumulative frequency curve for sieving from thin-section data without mathematical conversions. Moreover, the graph paper allows the direct determination of sieving parameters. The usefulness of the new method is illustrated by comparing it with conversion techniques developed from mathematical analysis.},

abstract = {It has been shown that a linear relationship exists for size analysis between the quartile measures of sieving and thin-section data. This study has been extended to moment measures since they are the most suitable statistics for describing the textural characteristics of sedimentary rocks. The present study shows that a linear relationship exists between the mean grain size for sieving and thin-section analysis. The conversion equation developed previously for converting thin-section quartiles to calculated sieving equivalent quartiles can be applied to mean grain size. The use of this equation results in a 1:1 relationship for mean grain size between sieving and thin-section data. Fig. 1 of this paper should be employed to obtain sieve size mean from thin-section mean. For mean deviation and standard deviation, a linear relationship holds between sieving and thin-section analyses. For higher moments (skewness and kurtosis) the correlation between sieving and thin-section data is not very significant. The correlation coefficient r for relating the moment measures of the 2 types of analysis decreases progressively from mean to mean deviation, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. The conversion equation which is valid for the size parameters is not applicable to mean deviation and standard deviation. For skewness and kurtosis observed and converted thin-section data are exactly the same to 3 significant digits.},

abstract = {The Carnian sandstones of the Southern Alps are fluviodeltaic and lagoonal clastic wedges derived from volcanic source rocks changing with time from mesosilicic to persilicic lavas and pyroclastics. Two-thirds of the variance in detfital modes reflect this petrologic evolution of the source. The effect of sedimentary processes is never strong enough to obscure the fundamental relationship of sandstone composition to provenance, but it accounts for most short-term variability in quartz/feldspar and feldspar/ volcanic rock fragment ratios. Plagioclase and quartz grains are concentrated, respectively, in the very fine to fine fractions and in medium-grained sandstones. The quartz/feldspar ratio (Q/F) thus decreases through delta-plain upward-fining sequences, from channel-lag sediments (Q/F = V3) to overbank sands (Q/F = t/a). The sedimentary control on the composition of flaviodeltaic sands results from the coupling of mechanical effects in high-gradient headwater streams and hydraulic sorting in low-gradient depositional environments. Assuming that the effectiveness of mineralogical segregation in different grain-size fractions during transport depends primarily on paleorelief, a decrease in altitude during Carnian times is inferred within the Triassic volcanic source, which lay south of the sedimentary depocenter. Reworking by weak traction currents in lagoonal settings has further increased the textural maturity and the mineralogical stability of the sands. Volcanic rock fragments were reduced by selective destruction in marine environments, but the Q/F ratio was not affected, and a common value of V6 characterizes all lagoonal strata. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {This contribution classifies detrital heavy mineral assemblages produced in contrasting geodynamic settings, following the provenance scheme proposed by Dickinson and co-workers in the late 1970s. The vital link with bulk-sediment detrital modes was established by systematically coupling high-resolution heavy mineral and petrographic analyses on the same sample sets, in a series of actualistic provenance studies carried out in key geological areas, characterised by arid to semiarid climate. Quartzofeldspathic to quartzose sands of “Continental Block Provenance” contain either heavy-mineral-rich, hornblende-dominated assemblages derived from amphibolite-facies basements exposed along rift escarpments and in cratonic shields, or heavy-mineral-poor suites with commonly rounded ultrastable grains recycled from cover strata. Volcanic rifted margins shed lithofeldspathic detritus with clinopyroxene-dominated suites (largely lilac-brown Ti-rich augite) that commonly include olivine. Abundant clinopyroxenes (mostly green augite) and hypersthene, associated with olivine or dark-brown to reddish-brown hornblende (oxyhornblende), characterise feldspatholithic sands of “Magmatic Arc Provenance”. The proportion of mainly blue-green hornblende increases progressively with erosion cutting deeper into the batholithic core of the arc massif. Quartzolithic sands of “Orogenic Provenance” include suites dominated by amphiboles, garnet, and epidote. The relative abundance of garnet (associated with subordinate staurolite, kyanite, and sillimanite) and blue-green to green-brown hornblende increases with increasing metamorphic grade of the sedimentary or igneous protoliths, respectively. Oman-type obduction orogens shed abundant heavy minerals, dominated by mafic and ultramafic minerals derived from the obducted ophiolite nappe. Apennine-type thin-skinned thrust belts provide heavy-mineral-poor assemblages recycled from accreted passive-margin successions or foredeep turbidites. Pyroxenes, derived from offscraped ophiolitic sequences, are locally present. The wealth of information heavy minerals provide on the geology of source areas makes their analysis an extremely powerful complementary tool in provenance studies of sediments not modified by diagenesis.},

abstract = {This article investigates both experimentally and theoretically the compositional changes associated with textural effects and hydraulic sorting during sediment transport and deposition, which cause systematic distortion in quantitative provenance analysis ("environmental bias"). Traditional procedures aimed at eliminating textural noise find limited success. The Gazzi-Dickinson method cannot remove hydrodynamic-related modal variability. Multiple size-window strategies are time-consuming. Narrow or moving size-window strategies represent misleading or impractical short cuts, being less convenient options than simply analysing each sample in bulk. New concepts introduced here unravel the superposed causes of compositional variability in modern sediments. Intrasample modal variability, fundamentally explained by settling-equivalence relationships, can be accurately modelled mathematically. Intersample modal variability, principally resulting from selective entrainment, can be assessed and removed by a simple principle. In absence of provenance changes and environmental bias, the weighted average density of terrigenous grains (SRD index) should be equal, for each sample and each grain-size class of each sample, to the weighted average density of source rocks. By correcting relative abundances of detrital minerals in proportion to their densities, we can restore the appropriate SRD index for any provenance and subprovenance type in each sample or grain-size class. Modal variability is effectively reduced by this procedure, which can be applied confidently to modern sediments deposited by tractive currents in any environment. Good results are obtained even for placer sands and finest classes where heavy-mineral concentration is strongest. Such "SRD correction" also successfully compensates for biased narrow-window modes, thus providing a numerical solution of general validity to the problem of environmental bias in sedimentary petrology. After compensating for settling-equivalence and selective-entrainment effects, residual size-dependent compositional variability may be provenance-related. Minor in Ganga-Brahmaputra sediments, provenance-related effects are spectacularly displayed in the Nile basin, where volcaniclastic silt mixes with basement-derived quartzofeldspathic sand and wind-blown Saharan quartz. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This study discusses the laws which govern sediment deposition, and consequently determine size-dependent compositional variability. A theoretical approach is substantiated by robust datasets on major Alpine, Himalayan, and African sedimentary systems. Integrated (bulk-petrography, heavy-mineral, X-ray powder diffraction) multiple-window analyses at 0.25ϕ to 0.50ϕ sieve interval of eighty-five fluvial, beach, and eolian-dune samples, ranging from very fine silt to coarse sand, document homologous intrasample compositional trends, revealed by systematic concentration of denser grains in finer-grained fractions (“size–density sorting”). These trends are explained by the settling-equivalence principle, stating that detrital minerals are deposited together if their settling velocity is the same. Settling of silt is chiefly resisted by fluid viscosity, and Stokes' law predicts that size differences between detrital minerals in ϕ units (“size shifts”) are half the difference between the logarithms of their submerged densities. Settling of pebbles is chiefly resisted by turbulence effects, and the Impact law predicts double size shifts than Stokes' law. Settling of sand is resisted by both viscosity and turbulence, the settling-equivalence formula is complex, and size shifts increase – with increasing settling velocity and grain size – from those predicted by Stokes' law to those predicted by the Impact law. In wind-laid sands, size shifts match those predicted by the Impact law; size–density sorting is thus greater than in water-laid fine sands. New analytical, graphical, and statistical techniques for rigorous settling-equivalence analysis of terrigenous sediments are illustrated. Deviations associated with non-spherical shape, density anomalies, inheritance from source rocks, or mixing of detrital species with contrasting provenance and different size distribution are also tentatively assessed. Such integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows us to mathematically predict intrasample compositional variability of water-laid and wind-laid sediments, once the density of detrital components is known.},

abstract = {By selecting a limited number of variables ( westward vs. eastward subduction polarity; oceanic vs. continental origin of downgoing and overriding plates), we identify eight end-member scenarios of plate convergence and orogeny. These are characterized by five different types of composite orogenic prisms uplifted above subduction zones to become sources of terrigenous sediments (Indo-Burman-type subduction complexes, Apennine-type thin-skinned orogens, Oman-type obduction orogens, Andean-type cordilleras, and Alpine-type collision orogens). Each type of composite orogen is envisaged here as the tectonic assembly of subparallel geological domains consisting of genetically associated rock complexes. Five types of such elongated orogenic domains are identified as the primary building blocks of composite orogens: magmatic arcs, obducted or accreted ophiolites, neometamorphic axial belts, accreted paleomargin remnants, and accreted orogenic clastic wedges. Detailed provenance studies on modern convergent-margin settings from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean show that erosion of each single orogenic domain produces peculiar detrital modes, heavy-mineral assemblages, and unroofing trends that can be predicted and modeled. Five corresponding primary types of sediment provenances ( magmatic arc, ophiolite, axial belt, continental block, and clastic wedge provenances) are thus identified, which reproduce, redefine, or integrate provenance types and variants originally recognized by W. R. Dickinson and C. A. Suczek in 1979. These five primary provenances may be variously recombined in order to describe the full complexities of mixed detrital signatures produced by erosion of different types of composite orogenic prisms. Our provenance model represents a flexible and valuable conceptual tool to predict the evolutionary trends of detrital modes and heavy-mineral assemblages produced by uplift and progressive erosional unroofing of various types of orogenic belts and to interpret petrofacies from arc-related, foreland-basin, foredeep, and remnant-ocean clastic wedges.},

abstract = {Sediment in coastal Namibia to southern Angola is supplied dominantly from the Orange River with minor additional fluvial input and negligible modifications by chemical processes, which makes this a great test case for investigating physical controls on sand texture and composition. This study monitored textural, mineralogical and geochemical variability in beach and aeolian-dune sands along a ca 1750 km stretch of the Atlantic coast of southern Africa by using an integrated set of techniques, including image analysis, laser granulometry, optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and bulk-sediment geochemistry. These results contrast with previous reports that feldspars and volcanic detritus break down during transport, that sand grains are rounded rapidly in shallow-marine environments, and that quartzose sands may be produced by physical processes. Mechanical wear is unable to modify the relative abundance of detrital components, including pyroxene and mafic volcanic rock fragments traditionally believed to be destroyed rapidly. The sole exceptions are poorly lithified or cleaved sedimentary/metasedimentary rock fragments, readily lost at the transition to the marine environment, and slow-settling flaky micas, winnowed and deposited offshore. Coastal sediments tend to be depleted in relatively mobile amphibole, preferentially entrained offshore or re-deposited in sheltered beaches, while less mobile garnet is retained onshore. No detrital mineral displays a significant increase in grain roundness after 300 to 350 km of longshore transport in high-energy littoral environments from the Orange mouth to south of the Namib Erg, but all minerals get rapidly rounded after passing into the dunefield. Pyroxene and opaques get rounded faster than harder quartz and garnet, but sand mineralogy remains unchanged. Excepting strong transient selective-entrainment effects, physical processes are unable to modify sand composition significantly. Selective mechanical breakdown can be largely neglected in quantitative provenance analysis of sand and sandstone even in the case of ultra-long-distance transport in high-energy environments dominated by strong persistent winds and waves.},

abstract = {Turbidite beds and pyroclastic density current deposits commonly show abrupt internal changes in grain size with stepwise upward fining. Grain-size breaks divide a turbidite bed into a lower sandy zone, a middle silty zone, and an upper muddy zone. Zone boundaries need not correspond with Bouma division boundaries, but the sandy zone usually consists of A, B, and occasionally C divisions, the silty zone is composed of one or more of the B, C, and D divisions, and the muddy zone correlates with division E. Pyroclastic density current deposits likewise display a tripartite zonation with prominent grain-size breaks. Divergence of particle-laden gravity currents into a lower dense body and an upper dilute turbulent wake can explain the formation of the lower grain-size break. Fine particles are elutriated into the wake region by ambient entrainment through the current head, while coarse grains are transported in the body. Particle size and concentration stratification is sustained by the turbulence and velocity structure of gravity currents, with a velocity maximum and turbulence minimum also dividing currents into two regions. Two stages of deposition result. The upper grain-size break may be produced by buoyant lofting, with fine particles convected into the water column or atmosphere as the flow wanes.},

abstract = {The Cameros Basin (Iberian Chain, NE Spain) formed during the latest Jurassic–Early Cretaceous rifting stage in an extensional regime characterized by high subsidence rates. Its sedimentary infill (thicker than 6000 m) has been subdivided into eight depositional sequences (DS) mainly composed of continental sediments. DS 1 and DS 2 represent the first rifting stage (Tera Group, Tithonian), mainly formed by fluvial and lacustrine sediments. Sandstone petrofacies evolved from quartz-sedimentolithic in DS 1 to quartz-feldspathic in DS 2 due to the rifting process. In DS 2, three different types of detrital feldspars (K-feldspars, albites and polysynthetic plagioclases) with similar sodium-rich compositions (mean: Ab94.0 An 4.5 Or1.5) can be recognized. Chemically pure nonluminescent albites (AbN 99{\%}) are common. In DS 2, diagenetic albitization of both plagioclases and K-feldspars is inferred from conventional microscopy observations, cathodoluminescence and electron microprobe analyses. DS 1 contains few plagioclase grains, which show no evidence of transformation into albite. Although the albitization is characterized as diagenetic it seems to be provenance-controlled since it affects the units showing higher original plagioclase/K-feldspar ratio (DS 2), due to the greater influence of plutonic and metamorphic source areas in DS 2. Possible Na sources are: (1) the percolation of moderate to high salinity residual brines from related alkaline lakes developed at top of DS 2 in the eastern sector of the basin, (2) clay mineral reactions (sodium smectite to illite and chlorite) indicated by mudstone composition in the interlayered mudstones, and (3) the replacement of detrital sodium plagioclases by carbonate. These three sources can be complementary.},

abstract = {Chemical weathering influences the detrital composition of sand-size sediment derived from source areas subject to different amounts of precipitation in the Coweeta Basin, North Carolina. Of the grain types studied, rock fragments are most sensitive to chemical degradation; therefore, their abundance is the best indicator of cumulative weathering effects. Destruction of sand-size rock fragments by chemical weathering is a function of both the intensity and duration of chemical weathering experienced by grains in regoliths of the source area. In the Coweeta Basin, the intensity of chemical weathering is directly related to the climate via effective precipitation in individual subbasins, whereas the duration of chemical weathering is inversely related to the relief ratio of the watershed. Therefore, soils in watersheds with low-relief ratios and high discharge per unit area experience the most extensive chemical weathering, and sediments derived from these watersheds contain the lowest percentage of rock fragments. The effects of climate alone cannot explain the systematic variation of rock fragment abundance in sediments from the Coweeta Basin. The compositional imprint left on these sediments by chemical weathering is a function of both climate and topographic slope in the sediment source area.},

abstract = {A new reconstruction of Alpine Tethys combines plate-kinematic modelling with a wealth of geological data and seismic tomography to shed light on its evolution, from sea-floor spreading through subduction to collision in the Alps. Unlike previous models, which relate the fate of Alpine Tethys solely to relative motions of Africa, Iberia and Europe during opening of the Atlantic, our reconstruction additionally invokes independent microplates whose motions are constrained primarily by the geological record. The motions of these microplates (Adria, Iberia, Alcapia, Alkapecia, and Tiszia) relative to both Africa and Europe during Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic time involved the subduction of remnant Tethyan basins during the following three stages that are characterized by contrasting plate motions and driving forces: (1) 131–84 Ma intra-oceanic subduction of the Ligurian part of Alpine Tethys attached to Iberia coincided with Eo-alpine orogenesis in the Alcapia microplate, north of Africa. These events were triggered primarily by foundering of the older (170–131 Ma) Neotethyan subduction slab along the NE margin of the composite African–Adriatic plate; subduction was linked by a sinistral transform system to E–W opening of the Valais part of Alpine Tethys; (2) 84–35 Ma subduction of primarily the Piemont and Valais parts of Alpine Tethys which were then attached to the European plate beneath the overriding African and later Adriatic plates. NW translation of Adria with respect to Africa was accommodated primarily by slow widening of the Ionian Sea; (3) 35 Ma–Recent rollback subduction of the Ligurian part of Alpine Tethys coincided with Western Alpine orogenesis and involved the formation of the Gibraltar and Calabrian arcs. Rapid subduction and arc formation were driven primarily by the pull of the gravitationally unstable, retreating Adriatic and African slabs during slow convergence of Africa and Europe. The upper European–Iberian plate stretched to accommodate this slab retreat in a very mobile fashion, while the continental core of the Adriatic microplate acted as a rigid indenter within the Alpine collisional zone. The subducted lithosphere in this reconstruction can be correlated with slab material imaged by seismic tomography beneath the Alps and Apennines, as well as beneath parts of the Pannonian Basin, the Adriatic Sea, the Ligurian Sea, and the Western Mediterranean. The predicted amount of subducted lithosphere exceeds the estimated volume of slab material residing at depth by some 10–30{\%}, indicating that parts of slabs may be superposed within the mantle transition zone and/or that some of this subducted lithosphere became seismically transparent.},

abstract = {The paleobathymetry of ancient turbidite basins has traditionally been dealt with in terms of paleontologic depth indicators. The calcite compensation depth now provides an additional bathymetric reference level. In this study the concept of carbonate compensation levels (CCL) has for the first time been applied in detail to Cretaceous turbidite basins. Out of the four East Alpine basins studied two (i.e., Flysch Zone of the East Alps and K{\"{o}}ssen Gosau Basin) have calcite-free hemipelagic green claystones of Campanian-Early Maestrichtian age and were below the CCL. Alternative causes such as climatic variations and terrigenous influx of carbonate-free detritus are unlikely to be major controlling factors for the absence of calcite in the hemipelagic claystones. Distinction between hemipelagic and turbiditic mudstones is facilitated by the high calcium carbonate content of the latter. Hemipelagic and pelagic layers of the same age in the other two basins (Reichenhall Gosau Basin and Ultrahelvetic flysch) contain calcite and were deposited above the CCL. Supporting evidence comes from microfaunal analysis. The hemipelagic layers of the Flysch Zone and K{\"{o}}ssen Basin contain aglutinating foraminifera, Radiolaria and some fish debris only. This fauna corresponds to Saidova's (1965a, b, 1970) "Astrorhizidae-Ammodiscidae taxocoenosis of oceanic type" from the. abyssal Pacific at depths greater than 3500 to 4500 m. It is largely identical to Brouwer's (1965) deep-water Rhabdammina fauna. With a few exceptions the hemipelagic layers lack calcareous planktonic and benthonic foraminifera. The turbidites, however, locally abound in them. In the Reichenhall Basin and Ultrahelvetic flysch the (hemi-) pelagic rock-types are generally richer in biogenic constituents than the turbiditic lithologies. Calcareous planktonic foraminifera prevail over benthonics. These findings support a proposed deep-sea trench environment of the Flysch Zone of the East Alps (Hesse 1974). The Ultrahelvetic Zone supposedly represents the northern slope facies of the Tethyan Sea. The Gosau Basins are located on the southern carbonate platform of the Northern Calcareous Alps which broke up into basins and highs and was tectonically displaced northward during the Cretaceous-Early Tertiary closure of the Tethyan Sea. That one of these basins of the Northern Calcareous Alps had apparently subsided to depth below the CCL is an unexpected finding.},

abstract = {The graded sandstones in the Prealpine flysch basins of late Cretaceous to middle Eocene age in Switzerland range in modal composition from arkoses to litharenites. The detritus is characterized by rock fragments from the crystalline basement and sedimentary cover (with volcanics), together with glauconite and shallow-water fossil fragments. Some of the flysch basins can be differentiated by the proportions of various rock fragments. The model for internal divisions in graded sandstones (Bouma, 1962) is modified to include small current ripples in the lower and upper divisions of horizontal lamination. The sandstone sole markings in the Basal Schlieren and Waggital sequences are parallel to within-bed currents measured in the lower division of horizontal lamination, current ripple division, and upper division of horizontal lamination. Within-bed current directions were measured using charcoal and parting-step lineations, small and large current ripples, and convolute lamination. There was no measurable effect due to the Coriolis force as the currents slowed down and deposited individual graded beds. Sandstone paleocurrents flowed soutwestward in the Basal Schlieren flysch and southward in the Waggital flysch. Ocean-bottom currents that oriented charcoal particles in interbedded green shales and micrite limestone flowed parallel, in each basin, to the currents from which the graded sandstones were deposited. Under an hypothesis of deposition of the graded sandstones from turbidity currents, the parallelism of ocean-bottom currents with sandstone sole markings could be fortuitous. However, one would expect that any postulated, down-slope, gravity-controlled turbidity currents would commonly flow in a direction different than ocean-bottom currents. Consequently an hypothesis that the graded sandstones were deposited from waning ocean-bottom currents is a distinct possibility. Furthermore, scatter diagrams among the textural variables of mean size, standard deviation, and skewness for the graded sandstones and siltstones are similar to scatter diagrams for sandstones and siltstones deposited by normal bottom currents in numerous continental and marine environments.},

abstract = {Differing methods of determining detrital modes of sand/sandstone have been developed by different "schools" due to different goals and different geologic settings. The Gazzi-Dickinson method of point counting was developed to maximize source-rock data, while minimizing the time, effort, and expense of gathering such data. Use of the method minimizes variation of composition with grain size, thus eliminating the need for sieving and multiple counts of different size fractions. Unsorted samples of any sand size may be used, thus allowing direct comparison between modern sands and poorly sorted ancient sandstones. The application of actualistic petrologic models relating composition to tectonic setting thus is facilitated. The unique aspect of the Gazzi-Dickinson method of point counting is the assignment of sand-sized crystals and grains within larger fragments to the category of the crystal or grain, rather than to the category of the larger fragment. In addition, every attempt is made to reconstruct original detrital compositions in spite of subsequent alterations. Six unconsolidated Holocene sand samples derived from a variety of source rocks in north-central New Mexico were collected, sieved, impregnated, sectioned, stained and point-counted, using both traditional and Gazzi-Dickinson methods. Results of these counts provide a comparative test of traditional and Gazzi-Dickinson methods. There are two reasons for variation of modal composition with grain size: 1) the breakage of fragments into constituent grains, and 2) actual mineralogic variation with grain size. The Gazzi-Dickinson method successfully eliminates the first source of compositional grain-size dependency. No point-counting method eliminates the second source. Use of the Gazzi-Dickinson method on unsorted samples produces results that are consistent with those from different size fractions of the same samples. Lithic-fragment compositions (for example, LmLvLs, QpLvmLsm) are especially consistent and provide the most useful parameters for relating composition to source rock and, ultimately, to tectonic setting.},

abstract = {Existing proposals for converting thin section data to their sieve equivalents are all flawed in various ways, while questions concerning the significance of the grain size of spherical grains measured on a volume frequency basis in thin section using /phi units, and of non-spherical (ellipsoidal) grains using both millimetres and /phi units, have not been -satisfactorily resolved in the literature. It can be shown mathematically that the mean thin section diameters of spherical grains, or axis lengths of a series of parallel sections through ellipsoidal grains, will underestimate the dimensions of the corresponding central section (i.e. one passing through the grain centre) by 0.2023 /phi when measured on a volume frequency basis. In order to approximate the effect of measuring particle size on random cuts through ellipsoidal grains, the dimensions of a series of sections cut in 49 unique directions, symmetrically arranged and evenly spread with respect to the ellipsoidal axes, were calculated. This calculation was carried out for five different ellipsoids which between them covered the mean sphericity and thin section axial ratio values normally encountered among naturally occurring quartz grain populations. The data indicated that the mean true nominal diameters (D) of ellipsoidal quartz grains can be obtained in thin sections from the mean nominal sectional diameters (d') and major axes (a') of the central sections (derived from the observed values by multiplying the millimetre means by 1,1318 and subtracting 0,2023 from the /phi means) using the following equations: A rough estimate (to within c. 5/{\%}) of both the mean nominal diameters and the mean long axes of ellipsoidal quartz grains can be arrived at by applying a simple correction factor to the mean long axis lengths as measured in thin section using either millimetres or /phi units.},

The principal first-order parameters include source rock composition, modification by chemical weathering, mechanical disaggregation and abrasion, authigenic inputs, hydrodynamic sorting, and diagenesis. Each of these first-order parameters is influenced to varying degrees by such factors as the tectonic settings of the source region, transportational system and depositional environment, climate, vegetation, relief, slope, and the nature and energy of transportational and depositional systems. These factors are not independent; rather a complicated web of interrelationships and feedback mechanisms causes many factors to be modulated by others. Accordingly, processes controlling the composition of clastic sediments are best viewed as constituting a system, and in evaluating compositional information the dynamics of the system must be considered as whole.},

Over the last 50 years, the palaeoenvironment of Tertiary Nummulites accumulations has been a matter of debate, particularly because of difﬁculties in interpreting these deposits, and in this way, the absence of analogues in present-day seas does not help. The aim of this paper is to insight the different ways Nummulites tests and clasts may accumulate according to their hydrodynamic behaviour. Based on experimental measurements and on SEM observations, it appears that the high primary skeletal porosity of Nummulites made them easily transportable. The calculated threshold shear velocities conﬁrm that large-sized Nummulites can be moved by weak wave-driven currents. This peculiar hydrodynamic behaviour of Nummulites could explain the diversity of depositional models. Depending on local hydrodynamic conditions, autochthonous Nummulites deposits can be preserved as in situ winnowed bioaccumulations or be accumulated offshore, onshore or alongshore, away from the original biotope.},

abstract = {Differences in framework composition of first-cycle sandstones within coarse-grained delta systems of the Fountain and Minturn Formations (Pennsylvanian) near Colorado Springs and McCoy, Colorado, largely are a function of variable mechanical disaggregation and hydrodynamic sorting characteristic of different depositional environments within the deltas. Modification of composition occurred in spite of deposition in a tectonically active setting where rates of sediment supply and burial were relatively high. Within a wave-dominated delta in the Fountain Formation near Colorado Springs foreshore sandstones are most mature (Q69F28R3) and offshore/transition sandstones are most immature (Q50F48R2). Differences in maturity reflect shoreline reworking processes. Feldspar is mechanically broken and abraded in the foreshore due to swash/backwash processes. Smaller grains of feldspar are winnowed from the foreshore and transported in suspension to the offshore during storms. The average composition of shoreface sandstone (Q62F34R4) closely resembles the composition of its precursor alluvial sandstone (Q61F35R4), suggesting most shoreface sand was derived directly from the alluvial channels and underwent little or no compositional change. However, the overall variability in the composition of shoreface sandstones is greater than that of alluvial sandstones, suggesting a more complex derivational history. Some samples of shoreface sandstone are enriched in feldspar, presumably derived directly by winnowing from the foreshore; other samples are enriched in quartz, indicating total reworking of coarser mature sand from the foreshore. The Minturn Formation near McCoy contains facies of river-dominated deltas, fed by both meandering- and braided-river systems. Differences in depositional processes between the two systems caused distinctly different modification of the framework composition of sandstones deposited in the two systems. Sand delivered by meandering-fluvial systems presumably formed under more intense weathering conditions and contains up to 8{\%} fewer rock fragments and as much as 12{\%} more feldspar than braided-fluvial sandstones. Compositions of fluvial sandstones were subsequently modified by marine processes and the compositions of the sandstones in the braided and meandering fluviodeltaic systems diverged even further. The primary variation in composition is reflected by a decrease in abundance of rock fragments, with resulting enrichment of quartz and feldspar. In both systems, beach facies are very similar in composition to their parent alluvial sand, suggesting that sand in the Minturn deltas had low residence time in the beach and that the beaches experienced low wave activity. Overall, the marine-influenced fades of meandering-fluviodeltaic origin are more distinct in composition than those of braided-fluviodeltaic origin. Although variation in grain size between fades accounts for most of the observed difference in composition of sandstones of the meandering-fluviodeltaic system, weak correlation between grain size and QFR composition indicates that grain size by itself cannot explain all of the compositional variation in sandstones of the braided-fluviodeltaic system. Differences in compositional modification between the wave-dominated (Fountain) and river-dominated (Minturn) coarse-grained deltas were due largely to subtle differences in the composition and grain size of alluvial sand brought to the shoreline and in both the rigor and duration of reworking in the marine environments of the two types of deltas. Largely as a consequence of the latter, the composition of beach sandstones of the Fountain was more distinctly modified relative to other facies in the Fountain. Also, more modification occurred in Fountain beach sandstones than in shoreline sandstones of the Minturn Formation where full-scale development of beaches and their long-term existence were prevented because of the dominance of fluvial processes on the delta plains and delta fronts.},

abstract = {The Tetori Group is a representative Middle Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous deposit in the northern central part of Honshu, Japan. The Tetori Group is divided into the Kuzuryu, Itoshiro and Akaiwa Subgroups with decreasing age. It consists mainly of a marine sequence in the lower part (Kuzuryu Subgroup) and non-marine sequence in the upper part (Akaiwa Subgroup) with transitional sequence in the middle part (Itoshiro Subgroup). Diagenesis of Tetori Group sandstones comprises compaction, cementation and replacement. Early diagenetic events include mechanical compaction, and pore-filling cementation of calcite, siderite, dolomite and formation of kaolinite. Late diagenesis includes formation of quartz cement and albitization of feldspar, and formation of illite, chlorite, calcite, ankerite and pyrite. Among the diagenetic minerals, carbonate forms the major cement in Tetori Group sandstones. Calcite of each subgroup is subdivided into two or three types based on cathodoluminescence. Tetori Group sandstones of marine, fresh-water, and mixed depositional environments are characterized by distinct chemical compositions of early diagenetic calcites. Late diagenesis seems to have been mainly influenced by detrital compositions of the sequence, burial temperatures and partially hydrothermal processes. Especially, late diagenetic carbonate and authigenic clay minerals seem to have formed mainly from ions released from clay mineral transformations in the adjacent shales. Based on the illite crystallinity (IC), the Kuzuryu Subgroup exhibits higher diagenetic grades than the overlying Itoshiro and Akaiwa Subgroups, indicating that the diagenesis of the Tetori Group was mainly affected by depth of burial.},

abstract = {There are few systematic investigations of variation in major element concentration with varying grain size in sandstone. In this study we examine the relationship between grain size and major element composition for four suites of sandstone, each with different modal composition and SiO2 content. The sandstones are sampled from Permian, Cretaceous and Paleogene turbidite sequences in Japan. We found that the effect of grain size on sandstone chemistry is related to the mineral composition of the sandstone itself. In commonly occurring sandstones that are composed mainly of quartz, feldspar and felsic (intermediate) volcanic rock fragments, a decrease in grain size is accompanied by a gradual decrease in SiO2 content and increase in TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 *, MgO, K2O and P2O5. The relationships can be largely explained by relative increases in the abundance of illite and chlorite in the fine-grained sediments. In contrast, sandstones that are derived mainly from basic volcanic rocks and that contain a high proportion of mafic minerals show different major element trends in response to grain size variation. In this group SiO2 and K2O contents increase gradually with decreasing grain size, whereas TiO2, Fe2O3 *, MgO, CaO and P2O5 decrease. The major element trends observed in these sandstones are related to syn-depositional hydraulic sorting of heavy mafic minerals from light felsic minerals such as quartz and feldspar. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Heavy-mineral grains in a sediment have hydrodynamic properties that are distinct from the particles of quartz and feldspar. Differences also occur within the suite of heavy minerals due to their ranges of densities, diameters and shapes. The contrasting hydrodynamic properties of these sediment grains can give rise to differential rates of transport by flowing fluids that yield distinct patterns of deposition based on the particle attributes. The higher densities and generally finer grain sizes make the heavy minerals more resistant to entrainment by flowing water, and they then experience lower rates of transport when carried as part of the bedload or in suspension where differences in grain settling velocities are important. In the extreme this hydrodynamic sorting can lead to the formation of heavy-mineral concentrates, or a placer when the deposit contains eco- nomically valuable minerals. The processes of mineral sorting have been investigated mainly in the context of the formation of placers found in rivers, beaches and in continental shelf sands. That research is reviewed in application to the hydrodynamic sorting of sediment grains in general, with the focus being on the mechanisms of selective entrainment, shear sorting during bedload trans- port, sorting within the geometry of bedforms such as ripples, and the effects of differences in particle settling velocities on grain sorting during suspension transport and when the sediments are deposited. Each of these mechanisms depends on the particle density, diameter and shape, and collectively account for the observed patterns of mineral sorting found in sediment deposits.},

abstract = {Previous attempts to deduce the flow parameters of turbidity currents from their deposited sediments have focused on applications of criteria for the suspension or autosuspension of the grains and on hydrodynamic interpretations of the characteristic Bouma sequence of sedimentary structures. There has been a considerable diversity of opinion, however, as to how the transport criteria relate to the observed deposited grain-size distribution, and no attempt has been made to determine whether the separate analyses of deposited sediments and sedimentary structures agree as to the magnitudes of the evaluated flow parameters. Such analyses are performed on a turbidite from the Capistrano Formation (Miocene-Pliocene) of California. This turbidite is normally graded from medium sand at its base to very fine sand and silt at the top, and has the complete sequence of Bouma structures. Only a small degree of cementation has occurred so that samples from the layer could be disaggregated and grain sizes determined both by sieving and sedimentation balance analyses. It was decided to employ the grain-suspension criterion for the calculation of the flow conditions at the time of deposition, published experiments on the pipe-flow of suspensions having demonstrated that this criterion is one of deposition versus non-deposition of grains according to their settling velocities. The published work relating types of sedimentary structures to the sediment grain size and either the flow power or Shield's dimensionless stress is used to evaluate the flow parameters from the observed Bouma sequence. All methods employed yield estimates of the mean flow velocity and bed stress (force per unit bottom area). The evaluated flow parameters for the transition from a flat bed to ripples (Bouma B to C divisions) are nearly an order of magnitude greater than obtained from the grain-suspension criterion where the calculations are based on the median grain size of the deposited sediments. Agreement results only if the calculations utilizing the suspension criterion are based on nearly the coarsest grains deposited at any instant, a procedure that is difficult to justify with the expected sediment deposition from a waning current. Inclusion of other factors, such as possible lags in sediment deposition or ripple formation beneath the decelerating flow, provide no firm explanation as to the cause of the discrepancy between the results based on the two approaches, and in nearly all cases their inclusion would increase the difference. Something is amiss with our procedures for the hydraulic interpretation of sediments which can be resolved only by further study.},

abstract = {Due to its flatness, the transport and deposifional regimes of mica are of particular intearcst in paleohydranlic interpretations of sediments. The present study examines the hydraulic equivalence of mica and quartz in a graded turbidite from the Capistrano Formation (Miocene-Pliocene) of California. Measurements of settling rates of mica grains from the deposit were obtained, and these served as the basis for the derivation of equations for the prediction of mica settling rates as a function of the ttatness of the mica plate as well as its diameter. One such relationship applies only to small grains in the Stokes range while a second applies to the full range of mica sizes. It was also determined that when mica is sieved the grains pass diagonally through the square sieve openings so that the intermediate axial diameter corresponds closely in size to the sieve diagonal. The results of these analyses permit more refined determinations of mica grain sizes and quantitative examinations ofthe hydraulic equivalence of mica and quartz. Although the mica in the turbidite is consistently coarser than the quartz, as expected for hydraulic equivalence, this detailed analysis indicates that they are not precisely equivalent, the mica having lower settling rates than the quartz deposited at the same time.

abstract = {Pronounced changes in chemical composition were detected upwards within single turbidite beds with SiO2 contents deceasing by as much as 20{\%}. All other major elements and eighteen trace elements increase in abundance upwards. Enrichment factors from bed base to top range from 1.2 (Na2O) to 5.7 (Cu). These changes are related to textural and mineralogical grading, that in turn were the result of turbidity current action before and during the deposition of the bed. We found only slight changes in the modal petrographic composition of the sandstone fractions, although this technique is operator-dependent and only semi-quantitative in nature. Chemical analysis appears to be a more sensitive, more rapid and less subjective method of determining provenance and the compositional contrasts within beds. Chemical anomalies produced by dilution effects from quartz overgrowths and intrabasinal material, however, show the need for utilisation of a combination of techniques, and for an appreciation of the interdependence of texture, framework modes and bulk chemistry. The chemical variations we detect in single beds also reflect the variation in a suite of representative samples collected from within a confined (several km2) geographic area. Hence, either sampling over a given area or specific sampling of individual beds (provided that the bed is typical of the succession as a whole) can be used to determine the compositional variations within a succession as a whole.},

abstract = {Some types of graded bedding, especially minor or isolated occurrences and varved "clays," can be readily accounted for by normal processes of sedimentation. Volcanic eruptions, dust storms, annual and longer climatic rhythms, rejuvenation of relief at the source or filling in of the sedimentary basin, churning up of sediment by storm waves, are among the more obvious potential causes of graded deposits. But the majority of occurrences cannot be explained by any of these processes. The authors believe turbidity currents of high density may be invoked to have supplied the sediment and deposited it in graded beds. The absence or insignificance of current bedding and ripple marking in graded deposits, the deposition of coarse material on the unconsolidated fine-grained top of the preceding bed, the enormous extent of each individual member without apparent change in thickness or character, and the frequent inclusion of angular fragments (even composed of clay) and of redeposited fossils are among the chief characteristics opposing transport and deposition by normal agents. All these and several other features, such as the often observed combination of grading with slumping, are explained by turbidity currents of high density. The graded graywacke series of some geosynclines, coarse graded conglomerates and breccias deposited in deep water, and some deep-sea sands can be accounted for in this manner. Experimental investigations on the nature of turbidity currents and the production of graded bedding are described, and the formation of certain graded rocks from the Apennines are treated in detail. Finally, an attempt is made to give a general elucidation of the formation of graded sediments by the action of turbidity currents of high density.},

abstract = {Zircons in transport in the modern Amazon River range from coarse silt to medium sand. Older grains are smaller on average: Mesozoic and Cenozoic grains have average equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) 122 ± 42 $\mu$m (lower fine sand), whereas grains {\textgreater}2000 Ma have average ESD 67 ± 14 $\mu$m (upper coarse silt). As a full Wentworth size class separates the two values, zircons in these age populations are hydraulically distinct. Host sand size is correlated with average size of co-transported zircons, implying hydrodynamic fractionation. Zircon size is positively correlated with percent medium sand, and inversely correlated with percent very fine sand (p {\textless}0.0001 in both cases). In samples with {\textgreater}50{\%} medium sand, average zircon size is 100 $\mu$m, compared with 80 $\mu$m in samples with {\textgreater}50{\%} very fine sand. We infer from these data that zircon deposition is not size-blind, and that zircons track with hydraulically comparable sand grains. As different aged grains tend to have different characteristic sizes, this indicates the possibility of hydrodynamic fractionation of age populations. Five samples representing different hydrodynamic microenvironments of a single dune present significantly different detrital zircon age spectra, apparently the result of hydraulic processes. Peak mismatch (age peaks failing to overlap at 2$\sigma$ level) is the most common disparity; but age populations present in some samples are missing from other samples. The lack of correspondence among the samples appears to exceed that attributable to random sampling. We conclude that hydrodynamic fractionation of zircons and zircon-age populations does occur. Zircon size should therefore be taken into consideration in detrital zircon provenance analysis.},

abstract = {Proper assessment of the relative importance of porosity loss by compaction and cementation is important to the prediction of porosity in sandstones, studies of mass transport during diagenesis, and the modeling of basin fluid flow. Quantitative estimation of the amounts of porosity loss by compaction and cementation can be made from standard point-count data on cement and pore space abundance. This method is discussed and its sources of error are evaluated. Error in the method arises mainly from uncertainty in initial sandstone porosities, and the amount of local grain dissolution during burial. Data on the porosity of modern sands indicate that assumed initial porosities of 40 to 45{\%} will produce small average errors in the calculation of compactional porosity loss for clean sandstones. Grain dissolution, whether resulting in local porosity enhancement by export in solution of former grain mass or local precipitation of authigenic cement, will cause an underestimation of the significance of compaction. A large database of point-count data from diverse sandstones is used to provide a broad perspective on the importance of compaction and cementation to sandstone porosity loss. It is shown that the global importance of compactional porosity loss has generally been under-appreciated. In fact, compaction (mechanical and chemical) is probably the dominant mechanism of porosity loss in most sandstones. The extent of compactional porosity loss is related to sand grain composition and basin thermal structure.},

For these sandstones, the interpretation of tectonic setting based on data exclusive of petrography does not coincide with the interpretation of tectonic setting based on their location on compositional diagrams. The anomalous sandstones can be separated into at least four categories: i) sandstones deposited during the transition between tectonic regimes may be derived, in part, from relict source rocks; ii) the relative enrichment of sandstones in detrital quartz by weathering and/or depositional reworking may lead to an inaccurate interpretation of tectonic setting from compositional data; iii) sandstones deposited in tectonic settings as yet unrepresented on the provenance diagrams may plot between the provenance fields or overlap existing fields; iv) the role of detrital carbonate rock fragments directly affects the location of data points on provenance diagrams, and is an unresolved problem. The first two categories represent permanent problems in the use of sandstone composition as an indicator of plate-tectonic setting, whereas the last two may only be temporary problems that can be solved by more data and a consensus on determining detrital modes. Recognition of anomalous sandstones in the rock record will reduce the probability of erroneous interpretations of tectonic setting and enhance the use of sandstone petrology as an indicator of plate-tectonic setting.},

abstract = {This study aims to unravel the impact of diagenetic alterations on porosity loss of foreland-basin turbiditic hybrid arenites and associated siliciclastic sandstones of the Eocene Hecho Group (south-central Pyrenees, Spain). In this succession, hybrid arenites and calclithites are extensively cemented by mesogenetic calcite cement (delta18O VPDB = –10.0 per thousand to –5.8per thousand ; Th, mode = 80° C; salinity mode = 18.8 wt{\%} eq. NaCl), Fe-dolomite (delta18O VPDB = –8.5 per thousand to –6.3 per thousand ) and trace amounts of siderite. The extent of carbonate cementation is interpreted to be related to the amounts of extrabasinal and intrabasinal carbonate grains, which provided nuclei and sources for the precipitation and growth of carbonate cements. Other diagenetic alterations, such as pyrite and albitization, had no impact on reservoir quality. Scarce early diagenetic cements, coupled with abundant ductile carbonate and siliciclastic framework grains, have led to rapid porosity loss owing to compaction. Conversely, abundant quartz in the sandstones prevented rapid loss of porosity by mechanical compaction. Reservoir quality was affected by mesogenetic cementation by quartz overgrowths, calcite and dolomite intergranular pressure dissolution of quartz grains, and formation of fracture-filling calcite cement (delta 18O V-PDB values from –10.4 per thousand to –7.8 per thousand ; Th temperatures of circa 150° C), which are attributed to deep circulation of hot meteoric waters during extensional stages of tectonism. The results of this study illustrate that diagenetic evolution pathways of the arenites and sandstones are closely linked to the variation in detrital composition, particularly the proportion and types of extrabasinal noncarbonates, extrabasinal carbonates, and intrabasinal carbonate grains. These insights suggest that marine turbiditic hybrid arenites and calclithites of foreland basins are subjected to more rapid and extensive porosity loss owing to compaction and cementation than associated siliciclastic sandstones. Degradation of reservoir quality makes these hybrid arenites, calclithites, and sandstones suitable as tight gas reservoirs, but only if fracture porosity and permeability develop during tectonic deformation.},

Differences are as great as 7$\epsilon$Ndunits, corresponding to Nd model ages that differ by up to 0.44 Gyr, and may be explained by separation (or unmixing) of components from different sources during sedimentary transport and sorting. For one sample, heavy-mineral fraction-ation may be indicated. These results have implications for studies of Nd model ages in sedimentary rocks, and for the interpretation of provenance from sedimentary petrography and geochemistry.},

Albitization of plagioclase and dissolution of unstable grains are the two principal mechanisms of grain alteration. Grain alteration increases progressively with depth and has taken place without the influence of significant amounts of meteoric fluids. The degree to which strictly subsurface grain alteration has affected these young sediments suggests that grain assemblages in older rocks should be viewed most skeptically with regard to their state of preservation.},

abstract = {Twenty-seven samples of feldspathic phyllarenite were obtained from three 1 m grids in a large, homogeneous distributary-bar sand stone body with the goal of elucidating bed-scale diagenetic het erogeneity. Significant variability in the content of both detrital and diagenetic components is present in the sample set. This variation is within the range of values predicted from comparison with a large regional data set from the same formation, but nonetheless, it is large enough to preclude successful prediction of diagenetic prop erties from consideration of average composition and thermal his tory alone. Grain size is one important local control on the overall abundances of cement and porosity. Grain size operates to control the overall degree of cementation (in these particular rocks, indi rectly) through its influence on lithic grain content and, hence, on compaction. Relatively minor carbonate cement is an exception to this trend and appears to be distributed somewhat randomly, with out regard to the size or composition of the detrital components. Diagenetic heterogeneity of the magnitude documented in this example is correlated to differences in porosity and permeability and therefore has implications for reservoir simulation and explo ration risk assessment. Prediction of rock properties through dia genetic modeling is more successful if the textural controls on dia genetic heterogeneity are considered.

abstract = {Fluvial and lacustrine (deltaic and turbiditic) sandstones are major hydrocarbon reservoirs in the onshore (Lower Cretaceous) Potiguar and Reconcavo rift basins in northeastern Brazil. Diagenetic elements including mechanically infiltrated (MI) clay, calcite, dolomite, and chlorite show distinct distribution patterns at interwell and field-wide reservoir scales. Such distributions, and thereby diagenetic heterogeneity, have been modeled based on thin-section, core, well-log, and petrophysical data. At the interwell scale, relationships between sandstone body geometry and the distribution of diagenetic elements are a critical aspect of reservoir heterogeneity. At this level, (1) MI clay concentrations occur in fluvial reservoirs following the orientation of paleochannels, generating strong compartmentalization of the reservoirs, (2) calcite cement appears either concentrated near sand-shale contacts (peripheral distribution) or dispersed in the interior of the sandstone layers (scattered distribution), (3) dolomite cement may appear concentrated along laminations in cross-stratified sandstones, causing a decrease of one order of magnitude in the effective horizontal permeability, and (4) authigenic chlorite is observed to reduce more significantly the permeability in fine-grained sandstones than in coarse-grained sandstones, an effect that may cause important modifications in the permeability structure of the reservoirs. At the field-wide scale, diagenetic heterogeneity includes (1) stratigraphic zonation of diagenetic properties in fluvial reservoirs, (2) increasing carbonate cementation toward the border of the hydrocarbon accumulations in deltaic reservoirs, and (3) distinct patterns of carbonate cementation observed in channel fills and lobes in turbiditic reservoirs. Incorporating the distribution and effects of diagenetic elements into the interwell and field-wide geological modeling is essential to achieve a realistic reservoir representation. Such incorporation is performed by the integration of diagenetic properties with other geological attributes, including nature and distribution of depositional facies, structural elements, and stratigraphic framework. This procedure improves reservoir quality evaluation and leads to more precise prediction of reservoir performance.},

Calcite (CaCO 3 {\textgreater} 99 mole {\%}) and kaolinite were formed as by-products of plagioclase albitization. Sodium-rich detrital plagioclase (An 2 -An 11 ) are usually unalbitized. Detrital K-feldspar is fresh or, rarely, partly albitized. Differences in albitization behavior of detrital plagioclase and K-feldspar are shown to be related to the chemistry of formation waters, reactivity of kaolinite, and temperature. The diagenetically formed albite pseudomorphs are very pure (Ab {\textgreater} 99), well-ordered low-albite, dark-luminescent, vacuolized, mostly untwinned, and comprised of numerous euhedral albite crystals. Some of the microporosity within the albite pseudomorphs is caused by volume reduction during albitization of the detrital plagioclase. The amount of albite formed in the pseudomorphs is related to the molar proportion of albite component in the detrital unstable Ca-rich plagioclase. The microporosity formed during albitization is proportional to the anorthite component, which is believed to have dissolved and resulted primarily in the formation of calcite and kaolinite. The albitization of detrital plagioclase in the studied sandstones can thus be explained without assuming the consumption of significant amounts of Na (super +) from pore solutions.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal distribution of diagenetic alterations in siliciclastic sequences is controlled by a complex array of interrelated parameters that prevail during eodiagenesis, mesodiagenesis and telodiagenesis. The spatial distribution of near-surface eogenetic alteration is controlled by depositional facies, climate, detrital composition and relative changes in sea-level. The most important eogenetic alterations in continental sediments include silicate dissolution and the formation of kaolinite, smectite, calcrete and dolocrete. In marine and transitional sediments, eogenetic alterations include the precipitation of carbonate, opal, microquartz, Fe-silicates (glaucony, berthierine and nontronite), sulphides and zeolite. The eogenetic evolution of marine and transitional sediments can probably be developed within a predictable sequence stratigraphic context. Mesodiagenesis is strongly influenced by the induced eogenetic alterations, as well as by temperature, pressure and the composition of basinal brines. The residence time of sedimentary sequences under certain burial conditions is of key importance in determining the timing, extent and patterns of diagenetic modifications induced. The most important mesogenetic alterations include feldspar albitization, illitization and chloritization of smectite and kaolinite, dickitization of kaolinite, chemical compaction as well as quartz and carbonate cementation. Various aspects of deep-burial mesodiagenesis are still poorly understood, such as: (i) whether reactions are accomplished by active fluid flow or by diffusion; (ii) the pattern and extent of mass transfer between mudrocks and sandstones; (iii) the role of hydrocarbon emplacement on sandstone diagenesis; and (iv) the importance and origin of fluids involved in the formation of secondary inter- and intragranular porosity during mesodiagenesis. Uplift and incursion of meteoric waters induce telogenetic alterations that include kaolinitization and carbonate-cement dissolution down to depths of tens to a few hundred metres below the surface.},

abstract = {The composition of heavy mineral assemblages in sandstones may be heavily influenced by processes operating during transport, deposition and diagenesis. As a consequence, conventional heavy mineral data may not be a reliable guide to the nature of sediment source material. Certain features of heavy mineral suites, however, are inherited directly from the source area without significant modification, such as the varietal characteristics of individual mineral species. This paper describes an alternative approach to varietal studies that concentrates on relative abundances of minerals that are stable during diagenesis and have similar hydraulic behaviour. Ratios of apatite to tourmaline, TiO2 minerals to zircon, monazite to zircon, and chrome spinel to zircon provide a good reflection of the source rock characteristics, because they are comparatively immune to alteration during the sedimentary cycle. These ratios are described as index values (ATi, RZi, MZi and CZi, respectively). This approach avoids some of the practical problems associated with varietal studies, such as the need to make subjective decisions about mineral properties or to use advanced analytical techniques that may not be accessible to the analyst. It also makes use of more components of the heavy mineral suite and thus provides a more balanced view of provenance characteristics. The use of these ratios is illustrated with examples from Upper Jurassic sandstones in the Outer Moray Firth area of the UK continental shelf and Triassic sandstones from onshore and offshore UK. Heavy mineral indices, notably ATi and MZi, show marked variations in Upper Jurassic Piper sandstones of the Outer Moray Firth. Main Piper sandstones have lower ATi and MZi values compared with Supra Piper sandstones, indicating significant stratigraphic evolution of provenance. The UK Triassic shows major regional variations in a number of index values, including ATi, MZi and CZi, demonstrating that sediment was supplied from several distinct source regions. This indicates a need for some modification of existing palaeogeographic models for the UK Triassic.},

abstract = {Sandstone compositions result from a complex interplay between provenance and factors that operate during the sedimentation cycle. Accurate identification and discrimination of provenance depends on isolating provenance-sensitive features, and avoiding parameters that are influenced by other factors. Heavy mineral analysis offers a high-resolution approach to determination of sandstone provenance, because of the diversity of mineral species found in sandstones and because the factors affecting assemblages have been comprehensively evaluated. This paper presents the current understanding of the effects of processes operative during the sedimentation cycle. The original provenance signal may be overprinted by weathering at source prior to incorporation in the transport system; by mechanical breakdown during transport; by weathering during periods of alluvial storage on the floodplain; by hydraulic processes during transport and final deposition; by diagenesis during deep burial; and by weathering at outcrop. The most influential of these processes are hydraulics, which fractionates the relative abundance of minerals with different hydraulic behaviour, and burial diagenesis, which reduces mineral diversity through progressive dissolution of unstable mineral species. There is also evidence that weathering during alluvial storage plays a significant role. Two alternative, complementary approaches are recommended to identify provenance from heavy mineral data. The relative abundances of minerals with similar hydraulic and diagenetic behaviour are largely unaffected by processes operative during the sedimentation cycle, and utilize information gained from the entire heavy mineral suite. Determination of such ratios can be augmented by acquisition of varietal data, concentrating on the varieties shown by mineral types within the assemblage. A number of different varietal techniques are recommended, including optical differentiation of types based on colour, habit and internal structure, single-grain geochemical analysis, and single-grain geochronology.},

abstract = {It is the aim of this contribution to test whether organic–inorganic interactions could induce the formation of authigenic albite. This concept and related results are being compared with modelling scenarios which are purely based on inorganic geochemical reactions. In order to unravel the pathway of authigenic albite formation, this paper presents results of a multidisciplinary study from imaging, geochemistry, mineralogy, and hydrogeochem- ical modelling. The Jurassic reservoir sandstones of the Magnus oilfield (UK, North Sea) were chosen as a test site. Albite occurs with 4–18 wt.{\%} in the Magnus sandstones and its contents vary with depth. However, albite contents increase with increasing K-feldspar contents and decreasing grain size. It occurs in three forms: (1) as lamellae in perthite, (2) as overgrowth on/in corroded feldspar, and, (3) as cloudy replacing albite patches in K-feldspar. The albite overgrowth has the highest chemical purity (100{\%} albite) whilst albite lamellae and replacing albite patches are slightly less pure (containing 1–4{\%} anorthite). Albite appears non-altered, and has a euhedral morphology and dull cathodoluminescence. It commonly co-occurs with corroded K-feldspar grains. The precipitation of diagenetic albite in the Magnus sandstones is attributed to deep burial 80 Ma ago and may have continued until today at temperatures between 90–120 °C. The results of hydrogeochemical modelling offer two possible pathways for the authigenic albite formation: (1) Dissolution of unstable minerals (such as kaolinite and chalcedony) coupled to reduction of ferric iron minerals by products generated during oil genera- tion, migration and degradation; (2) Dissolution of non-end member feldspar, such as K-feldspar with 10{\%} albite, coupled to illite formation can account for trace amounts of albite due to an elevated Na+/K + activity ratio in the pore water.},

abstract = {The complexity of flow and wide variety of depositional processes operating in subaqueous density flows, combined with post-depositional consolidation and soft-sediment deformation, often make it difficult to interpret the characteristics of the original flow from the sedimentary record. This has led to considerable confusion of nomenclature in the literature. This paper attempts to clarify this situation by presenting a simple classification of sedimentary density flows, based on physical flow properties and grain-support mechanisms, and briefly discusses the likely characteristics of the deposited sediments. Cohesive flows are commonly referred to as debris flows and mud flows and defined on the basis of sediment characteristics. The boundary between cohesive and non-cohesive density flows (frictional flows) is poorly constrained, but dimensionless numbers may be of use to define flow thresholds. Frictional flows include a continuous series from sediment slides to turbidity currents. Subdivision of these flows is made on the basis of the dominant particle-support mechanisms, which include matrix strength (in cohesive flows), buoyancy, pore pressure, grain-to-grain interaction (causing dispersive pressure), Reynolds stresses (turbulence) and bed support (particles moved on the stationary bed). The dominant particle-support mechanism depends upon flow conditions, particle concentration, grain-size distribution and particle type. In hyperconcentrated density flows, very high sediment concentrations ({\textgreater}25 volume{\%}) make particle interactions of major importance. The difference between hyperconcentrated density flows and cohesive flows is that the former are friction dominated. With decreasing sediment concentration, vertical particle sorting can result from differential settling, and flows in which this can occur are termed concentrated density flows. The boundary between hyperconcentrated and concentrated density flows is defined by a change in particle behaviour, such that denser or larger grains are no longer fully supported by grain interaction, thus allowing coarse-grain tail (or dense-grain tail) normal grading. The concentration at which this change occurs depends on particle size, sorting, composition and relative density, so that a single threshold concentration cannot be defined. Concentrated density flows may be highly erosive and subsequently deposit complete or incomplete Lowe and Bouma sequences. Conversely, hydroplaning at the base of debris flows, and possibly also in some hyperconcentrated flows, may reduce the fluid drag, thus allowing high flow velocities while preventing large-scale erosion. Flows with concentrations {\textless}9{\%} by volume are true turbidity flows (sensu Bagnold, 1962), in which fluid turbulence is the main particle-support mechanism. Turbidity flows and concentrated density flows can be subdivided on the basis of flow duration into instantaneous surges, longer duration surge-like flows and quasi-steady currents. Flow duration is shown to control the nature of the resulting deposits. Surge-like turbidity currents tend to produce classical Bouma sequences, whose nature at any one site depends on factors such as flow size, sediment type and proximity to source. In contrast, quasi-steady turbidity currents, generated by hyperpycnal river effluent, can deposit coarsening-up units capped by fining-up units (because of waxing and waning conditions respectively) and may also include thick units of uniform character (resulting from prolonged periods of near-steady conditions). Any flow type may progressively change character along the transport path, with transformation primarily resulting from reductions in sediment concentration through progressive entrainment of surrounding fluid and/or sediment deposition. The rate of fluid entrainment, and consequently flow transformation, is dependent on factors including slope gradient, lateral confinement, bed roughness, flow thickness and water depth. Flows with high and low sediment concentrations may co-exist in one transport event because of downflow transformations, flow stratification or shear layer development of the mixing interface with the overlying water (mixing cloud formation). Deposits of an individual flow event at one site may therefore form from a succession of different flow types, and this introduces considerable complexity into classifying the flow event or component flow types from the deposits.},

The total number of nominal grains per gram of sediment sample has been defined as the “nominal grain abundance”, which is a function of the volume (or weight) of the total mineral in the sample. Study of a simple, graded, Tertiary turbidite indicates that the least vertical change in heavy-mineral content occurs at, or slightly above, the middle part of the bed.

abstract = {The glauconitic facies is widespread on present-day continental shelves from 50° S to 65° N and at water depths between 50 and 500 m, and is in particularly great abundance on the upper slope and outer shelf between 200 and 300 m. It is also common in many ancient rocks of post-late Precambrian age. It occurs as sand- to pebble-sized, essentially green particles (granular facies) but also as a surface coating on particles and hardgrounds and as a diffuse impregnation (film and diffuse facies). We suggest the replacement of the term ‘glauconite', which has been interchangeably used to designate a morphological form and a specific mineral, by glaucony (facies) and glauconitic smectite and glauconitic mica as end members of the glauconitic mineral family. The widely accepted model of Burst and Hower for glauconitization requires a degraded, micaceous (2: 1 layer lattice structure) parent clay mineral. However, detailed analysis of numerous samples of Recent glaucony reveals that such a parent substrate is exceptional. The model therefore requires modification. Generally the parent material is carbonate particles, argillaceous (kaolinitic) faecal pellets, infillings of foraminiferal tests, various mineral grains and rock fragments, that pass gradually into the commonly occurring green grains. We show that the process of glauconitization is achieved by de novo authigenic growth of automorphous crystallites in the pores of the substrate, accompanied by progressive alteration and replacement of the substrate. It is this two-fold evolution that causes the ‘verdissement'of granular substrates, macrofossils and hardgrounds. The authigenic mineral is an iron-rich and potassium-poor glauconitic smectite. While new smectites are growing into the remaining pore space the earlier smectites are modified by incorporation of potassium, producing decreasingly expandable minerals with a non-expandable glauconitic mica as the end member. This mineralogical diversity of the glauconitic mineral family explains the highly variable physical and chemical properties of glaucony. Four categories, nascent, little-evolved, evolved and highly-evolved glaucony are distinguished. Glauconitization appears to be controlled by a delicate balance between degree of physical confinement of a particle and the amount of ionic exchange between the micro-environment and ambient open marine sea water. The optimum conditions for glauconitization are those of semi-confinement. As a result the interior of a grain is more glauconitized than its less confined periphery. Similarly, for identical substrate types, large grains (500$\mu$m) provide more favourable substrates for glauconitization than lesser confined small grains. On a larger scale the formation of glaucony is governed by the availability of iron and potassium and the balance between detrital influx and winnowing. Low accumulation rates expose grains to the open marine environment for sufficiently long times (105-106 years for highly-evolved glaucony).},

abstract = {The Upper Cambrian (St. Croixan Series) in the northern portion of the upper Mississippi Valley consists primarily of sandstone with minor amounts of shale and carbonate. This paper presents data on the relation of the mineralogy of the sandstones, particularly feldspar content, to grain size and depositional environments. Feldspar is far more abundant in some formations than previously recognized and consists of detrital K-feldspar grains with low-temperature K-feldspar overgrowths. The abundance of feldspar in these sandstones is nearly linearly related to the volume of very fine sand and, to a lesser extent, to the coarse silt size grains present because most of the feldspar grains are {\textless} 0.125 mm except where greatly enlarged by overgrowths. As a result of the small size of the feldspar, quartz arenites ({\textless} 10{\%} feldspar) usually have mean sizes {\textgreater} 0.177 mm. Arenites having mean sizes between 0.177 mm and 0.105 mm are usually feldspathic (10-25{\%} feldspar), while arenites and siltstones with mean sizes between 0.105 mm and 0.053 mm are usually highly feldspathic (25-70{\%} feldspar). Feldspar and glauconite abundance and distribution are strongly related to the energy regime of the depositional environments. The quartz arenites are characteristic of high energy regimes (littoral and nearshore environments). The feldspathic and highly feldspathic arenites are characteristic of low energy regimes (shelfal environments). Feldspathic and highly feldspathic arenites in which glauconite is abundant were formed primarily on the shoreward side of the shelf environment. A hydrodynamic model is proposed to explain the small grain size of the feldspar, the repetitive stratigraphic occurrence of feldspathic units, and the regional distribution of feldspathic and nonfeldspathic facies. Because of its excellent cleavage, the feldspar was differentially abraded during passage through extensive high energy environments then sorted and deposited in low energy environments.},

abstract = {New biostratigraphic, sedimentological and petrographic data and a thorough review of existing literature modify existing knowledge on the age, the sedimentology, the petrography and the palaeogeographic origin of the Gurnigel flysch from the Voirons massif (Haute Savoie, France). Planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy assigns the flysch to the upper Middle Eocene (zones P12 to P14) through to Lower Oligocene (zones P16 to P20) stages. This result contrasts with previous work, which assigned the unit to the Lower Palaeocene to upper Middle Eocene on the basis of calcareous nannofossil and dinoflagellate assemblages. The following findings suggest that the Voirons massif comprises several stacked flysch units that do not have exactly the same palaeogeographic origin: (i) the occurrence of flysch exposures in reverse stratigraphic order combined with the lack of evidence for bed overturning; (ii) the variability of palaeo-depositional settings inferred from different flysch outcrops of similar age; (iii) the differences in the heavy mineral content; and (iv) the anomalous superimposition of distal turbidites and/or basinal contourites (Saxel Marls) over proximal turbidites (Vouan Conglomerates). The young age of these kilometre-sized flysch slices precludes their hitherto postulated locus of deposition in the South-Penninic Ocean, and rather indicates a provenance from the Ultrahelvetic and/or North-Penninic (Valais) palaeogeographical domains. Finally, none of the nannofossil assemblages are contemporaneous with the observed planktonic foraminifera associations, suggesting that they have been reworked, dissolved, or just simply diluted and not found by earlier researchers. This study from the Voirons massif shows that planktonic foraminifera associations are a highly reliable biostratigraphic tool for obtaining accurate ages of flysch successions.},

abstract = {To evaluate compaction as a factor in porosity evolution, a plot of intergranular volume vs. depth was constructed using data from relatively uncemented reservoir sandstones from a variety of depths, ages, and geographic locations. The resulting intergranular- volume-decline curve reveals that sands compact mechanically and intergranular volume declines rapidly, from about 40 to 42{\%} at the surface, to about 28{\%} at 1500 m. Between about 1500 and 2500 m, intergranular volume continues to decline slowly, until the framework stabilizes at around 26{\%} (maximum potential porosity in the absence of cement or matrix). No further significant decrease in intergranular volume is observed to the depth limits of the data set at 6700 m. Comparison of intergranular volume and volume of quartz cement for different formations reveals no obvious balance between intergranular pressure solution (as monitored by inter- granular volume) and quartz cementation. This indicates that grain- to-grain pressure solution and quartz cement precipitation do not proceed concomitantly on the thin-section scale. Moreover, grain compaction is limited (to about 26{\%} intergranular volume) in rigid- grain sandstones, which suggests that the occurrence and distribu- tion of deep porosity is a function of the volume of cement available to fill the intergranular pores. Therefore, deep, porous sandstones are relatively uncemented rather than undercompacted.},

abstract = {Turbidity currents are commonly super critical if they travel on slopes steeper than 0.001. Hence, upon deceleration, such flows must pass a hydraulic jump. It is, therefore, surprising that sedimentary features related to the hydraulic jump are so poorly known and not clearly related to the Bouma sequence. To study this missing link, a stability diagram of bed forms generated by decelerating, initially super critical turbidity currents is presented here to sketch the position of hydraulic jump deposits relative to super and sub-critical bed forms observed in turbidites. The axes of the diagram are formed by the densiometric Froude number, the grain size and the particle fall-out rate. Experimental evidence shows that the hydraulic jump is hardly manifested in the deposit if turbidity currents pass the jump as a low-concentration, single-phase suspension flow. Only those turbidity currents that develop two-phase suspension flow with a super critical flowing traction carpet cause vigorous erosion and liquefaction of the substrate at the jump locality to produce rip-up of the substrate, rip-up clasts and flame structures, which are trapped in structureless, coarse-tail graded deposits characteristic of the classic Bouma Ta unit. The location of the jump is sensitive to density/velocity variations of the traction carpet and can shift rapidly up and down the slope. This would explain why structureless, coarse-tail graded deposits, such as Bouma Ta develop sheet-like. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The transportation mode for large, isolated clasts “floating” in turbidites is a problem that has been difficult to resolve. New observations from experimental, high-density turbidity currents indicate that large, outsized clasts can be transported along a rheological interface which develops within the flow. The clasts “glide” along the top of an underlying, pseudolaminar inertia-flow layer, partly submerged in it, and are driven by the downflow component of turbulent shear-stresses transmitted from the overlying, faster-moving turbulent layer. As the inertia-flow layer freezes and a new one forms, or as the layer thickens, the gliding clast may be forced to a progressively higher level within the flow. With deceleration, the inertia-flow phase of the flow freezes entirely and the large clast is then trapped “suspended” above the base of the resulting turbidite. Both a(p)a(i) and a(t)b(i) orientations of the floating clasts are observed. It is suggested that, hypothetically, a similar mechanism for megaclast emplacement may also operate in other types of viscous sediment flows, subaqueous or subaerial, wherever there is a distinct rheological interface developed within the flow.},

While grain composition varies spatially, the population sampled at any one location is hydrodynamically equivalent. Spatial variations in composition of the deposits are modeled using exponential decay functions, which are based on initial concentration of grain types and their respective differences in settling velocity.

They comprise a stack of sedimentary nappes related to palaeogeographic realms ranging from the Ultrahelvetic to the Southern Penninic. The provenance analysis is based on the Gazzi-Dickinson method, and on QEMSCAN{\textregistered} for heavy-minerals. The Quartzose petrofacies is the most important of the two sources, and supplied three of the four formations of the Voirons Flysch. It is similar to the sources that fed the other flyschs from the Gurnigel nappe. It is characterised by a mature, quartz-rich assemblage and a heavy mineral population dominated by apatite and the zircon-tourmaline-rutile mineral group. These observations suggest a Clastic wedge provenance. The Feldspathic petrofacies is derived from a feldspar-rich source associated with metamorphic clasts and a heavy mineral population dominated by garnet. This provenance characterises only one formation of the Voirons Flysch, and is related to the Axial Belt provenance. This provenance analysis shows that the Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene Voirons Flysch was fed by two sources, in contrast to the other flyschs of the Gurnigel nappe, and further suggests that this flysch was not deposited in the Piemont Ocean but in the Valais domain. Based on the results and comparative provenance analysis with the other flyschs of the Gurnigel nappe, we propose a generic feeding model which involves the Sesia-Dent Blanche nappe, the sedimentary nappes incorporated in the accretionary prism, and probably the Brian{\c{c}}onnais basement.},

They are generally related to distinct approaches in species classification and the use of different zonal schemes. Based on our data, the age of the Voirons Flysch extends from the Early Eocene (planktonic foraminiferal zone P7) to the Middle Eocene (planktonic foraminiferal zone P12). Contrasting with claims made in earlier studies, no specimen of Late Eocene or Early Oligocene age has been observed in the revised material.

The distribution of siderite and iron-oxide/oxyhydroxide is considered to reflect a second-order paleoclimatic signature recognized throughout the Carboniferous, where siderite formed during everwet periods and iron-oxide/oxyhydroxide during semi-arid conditions, reflecting differences in redox. Second, framework grain composition controlled the distribution of diagenetic products in the burial environment. Lithic arenites are deficient in authigenic quartz, yet have undergone various degrees of illitization. Quartz deficiency is attributed to compaction-related loss of primary porosity relatively early, which inhibited sufficient fluid flow to account for much higher concentrations of quartz cement in the more competent quartz-rich sandstones.},

abstract = {Apart from Bouma sequences, recurrent patterns of sedimentation can be recognized at two hierarchic levels in turbidite formations of the northern Apennines. First order cycles (turbidite suites) encompass most of the basin fill, second order cycles (megasequences) occur as organized groups of beds 2-70 m thick within the suites. The Marnoso-arenacea (Lower-Upper Miocene) is an example of a progradational or offlapping suite with thickening and coarsening upward trend. The Laga Formation (Upper Miocene-Lower Pliocene) is characterized by a "transgressive" (retrogradational) or onlapping trend. Vertical facies changes go either way through the following steps: basin plain {\textless}----{\textgreater} outer fan {\textless}----{\textgreater} midfan {\textless}----{\textgreater} inner fan {\textless}----{\textgreater} slope deposits (--{\textgreater} = prograding, {\textless}-- = receding). Both suites are enclosed by hemipelagic pelites and chaotic deposits, the start of turbidite sedimentation being gradual in the progradational case, and abrupt (large scale erosion) in the reverse one. Second order cycles follow each other or are separated by monotonous (uniform or irregularly bedded) sequences of extremely variable thickness (2 to more than 1,000 m) composed either of fan (overbank, fringe) or basin plain deposits (with key beds laterally continuous up to 175 km). The trend of cycles may be asymmetric (termed positive when beds thin upward, negative when they thicken upward), symmetric, composite or not definable. Thick to massive beds with sand/shale ratio {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1 or {\textgreater} 1 and well developed coarse divisions (products of high density turbidity currents, grain flows, debris flows, fluidized flows) form the thicker bedded portion of cycles and sometimes the whole cycle. One hundred and thirty-two cycles were analyzed and subdivided into simple and complex (= multiple or composite). By splitting multiple cycles into simple components, a total of 170 cycles was reached. Thirty-nine of them were measured in channelized deposits, 131 in non-channelized turbidites, laterally continuous exposures enabling the distinction to be made. Results of sequence analysis are illustrated by columnar profiles and bed thickness diagrams, i.e . CD (coarse division) and L (layer) diagrams. Eighty percent of channelized cycles show a positive trend, whereas a negative trend characterizes 60{\%} of non channelized cycles. This strengthens the assumption that most positive cycles reflect filling of fan channels, while negative cycles are the expression of prograding depositional lobes, i.e. localized areas of preferred sand accumulation in front of distributary channels. Among progradational cycles, a distinction was made between "fast" and "slow" accretion types by means of relative number of beds (L/T ratio), relative number of coarse divisions (L/CD ratio), and frequence of interbedded hemipelagites. The possible non-progradational nature of some "slower" cycles is discussed; they could alternatively reflect sporadic phases of sand accumulation in the basin plain environment due to huge flows triggered by tectonic events and bypassing the fan system (or independent from a fan system). Attempts of correlation of negative cycles both downcurrent and across current are shown.},

abstract = {The factors that control the distribution of heavy minerals in natural sandstones are so numerous and complex that their separate effects are difficult or even impossible to untangle. However, a theoretical approach to the problem indicates something of the relative importance of each. Factors such as differences in the density and hardness of the various minerals, differences in the original size of the various mineral grains in the source rock, the amount of abrasion that all grains have undergone during transportation, the different settling velocities of the various grains at the site of deposition, and the degree of sorting to which all grains were subjected there--all these factors seem competent to cause large variations in the relative abundance of various minerals in different samples of deposits that have been derived from exactly the same source rock and also in different size fractions of each of the samples. Certain of the factors, such as abrasion, tend to concentrate the heavier minerals in those samples that are predominantly finer grained; whereas other factors, such as sorting, tend to concentrate the heavier minerals in the finer grained portions of each sample, regardless of whether that sample is predominantly fine-grained or coarse-grained. The selective effects upon different minerals of the various influences, as deduced from theoretical considerations, appear to be confirmed by the evidence of actual sand samples. These effects seem sufficiently large to merit attention when using heavy mineral suites as a basis for correlation or for inferences about the character of source rock. Unless all the samples to be compared are of approximately the same grain size and the same degree of sorting, it is suggested that, in order to make allowances for these effects, heavy mineral separates be taken from two selected size fractions of each sample--one, representing the same actual grain size, the other, the same relative grain size in each sample.},

abstract = {A complete Alpine cross section integrates numerous seismic reflection and refraction profiles, across and along strike, with published and new field data. The deepest parts of the profile are constrained by geophysical data only, while structural features at intermediate levels are largely depicted according to the results of three-dimensional models making use of seismic and field geological data. The geometry of the highest structural levels is constrained by classical along-strike projections of field data parallel to the pronounced easterly axial dip of all tectonic units. Because the transect is placed close to the western erosional margin of the Austroalpine nappes of the Eastern Alps, it contains all the major tectonic units of the Alps. A model for the tectonic evolution along the transect is proposed in the form of scaled and area-balanced profile sketches. Shortening within the Austroalpine nappes is testimony of a separate Cretaceous-age orogenic event. West directed thrusting in these units is related to westward propagation of a thrust wedge resulting from continental collision along the Meliata-Hallstatt Ocean further to the east. Considerable amounts of oceanic and continental crustal material were subducted during Tertiary orogeny, which involved some 500 km of N-S convergence between Europe and Apulia. Consequently, only a very small percentage of this crustal material is preserved within the nappes depicted in the transect. Postcollisional shortening is characterized by the simultaneous activity of gently dipping north directed detachments and steeply inclined south directed detachments, both detachments nucleating at the interface between lower and upper crust. Large scale wedging of the Adriatic (or Apulian) lower crust into a gap opening between the subduced European lower crust and the pile of thin upper crustal flakes (Alpine nappes) indicates a relatively strong lower crust and detachment between upper and lower crust.},

abstract = {The Monte Antola Flysch consists of alternating calcareous turbidites and subordinate non-carbonate "background" sediment. Graded units as much as 28 m thick (but averaging less than 1 m) were deposited by "single events," and one-half to three-fourths of this material is finer than medium silt. Most of the calcareous sediment is shown to be a reworked and sorted pelagic ooze containing abundant coccoliths, planktonic Foraminifera, sponge spicules, and echinoderm fragments. Chert occurs as cement and replacement; calcite is the major cement and replaces sponge spicules. Evidence for turbidity current emplacement includes repeated graded bedding, microscopic shape sorting, sole markings, Bouma intervals, reworking of Foraminifera, and burrowing from the upper surfaces of beds. All criteria indicate a very distal environment of deposition, and these units clearly show that much of the fine-grained material associated with flysch deposits may be introduced by turbidity currents and not as hemipelagic material. Reworking of contemporaneous deep-water carbonate oozes into a distal environment of deposition, with sediment ponding yielding theobserved thicknesses, and coupled with the absence of carbonate material in the background sediment, are indicative of abyssal-plain sedimentation, probably at depths below the CaCO3 compensation level (4500 to 5000 m in modern oceans). The presence of an oceanic basin in the northern Appennines during the Late Cretaceous has considerable significance for hypotheses on the evolution of the Mediterranean region.},

abstract = {The main facies of flysch in the Northern Apennines are listed, the importance of calcareous turbidites being noted. A summary is presented of Italian studies on selected sedimentologic features of the Apennines turbidites: (1) Data on the occurrence of internal sedimentary structures in the turbidite rhythms, in function of thickness and grain size; the same in the flysch bands of thin or thick turbidites. (2) Statistics on the occurrence and size of sole markings. (3) Data on the relations between grain size and rhythm thickness. (4) Types of graded bedding. (5) Results of fabric studies. (6) Data on the petrography of the turbidite sandstones. The sandstones are either feldspathic sandstones (up to arkoses and feldspathic litharenites) with a greywacke-like texture and secondary calcite, or very calcareous sandstones, either lithic or quartzose and fossiliferous. The micaceous matrix of the first group appears to be derived mainly from the diagenesis of clay and the fragmentation of metamorphic mica and micaceous rock fragments. The interstitial calcite of the second group is micrite and recrystallized sparry calcite; calcite as a primary cement is not common. Rock fragments are important in the classification of the sandstones. The main types are phyllite, quartzite, serpentinite, micritic limestones, dolostone and rhyolite to andesite lavas. The fact that various sandstones of the same age are different in composition and yet sandstones of different age can be grouped together, indicate the importance of separate sources repeatedly active through time. The Corsica-Sardinia Hercynian Massif was an important source, especially in the Upper Cretaceous, but in the Tertiary, internal sources in the Apennines-Western Alps geosynclinal belt became predominant. In general tectonics played an important role as a source factor in the genesis of the Apennines sandstones, but reworking appears to have been limited.},

@article{Shanmugan2000,
abstract = {Under the prevailing turbidite paradigm, the term turbidite (i.e., deposits of turbidity currents with Newtonian rheology and turbulent state) is used very loosely and is commonly applied to deposits of debris flows with plastic rheology and laminar state. For example, because high-density turbidity currents are defined on the basis of three different concepts (i.e., flow density, grain size, and driving force), there are no consistent criteria for recognition of their deposits. As a result, deep-water massive sands of debris-flow origin are routinely misinterpreted as high-density turbidites. The concept of waxing flow as a type of turbidity current is problematic because waxing flows are defined on the basis of velocity, not on fluid rheology and flow state. The waxing-flow concept allows inversely graded sands to be misinterpreted as turbidites. Perhaps, the most problematic issue is the use of alluvial channel traction bed forms observed in flume experiments as the analog for the five divisions of the Bouma Sequence (i.e., classic turbidites deposited from suspension). This is because flume experiments were conducted under equilibrium flow conditions, whereas natural turbidity currents deposit sediment under disequilibrium waning flow conditions. This and other problems of deep-water processes and facies models are addressed in this paper from the authors personal perspective. Classification of sediment-gravity flows into Newtonian flows (e.g., turbidity currents) and plastic flows (e.g., debris flows), based on fluid rheology and flow state, is a meaningful and practical approach. Although popular deep-water facies models are based on transport mechanisms, there are no standard criteria in the depositional record to reliably interpret transport mechanisms. According to existing turbidite-facies models, an ideal turbidite bed, which has normal grading, with gravel- to mud-size particles should contain a total of 16 divisions. However, no one has ever documented a complete turbidite bed with 16 divisions in modern or ancient deposits. Recognition of units deposited by deep-water bottom currents (also referred to as contour currents) is difficult. Traction structures are good indicators of bottom-current reworking, but distinguishing deposits of bottom currents from deposits of overbanking turbidity currents is difficult even though it has important implications for developing depositional models for hydrocarbon exploration and production. I consider sandy debris flows to be the dominant process responsible for transporting and depositing sands in the deep sea. Experiments on sandy debris flows suggest that low clay content (as little as 1{\%}) is sufficient to provide the strength necessary for sandy debris flows. Deposits of experimental sandy debris flows are characterized by massive sand, sharp upper contacts, floating clasts, inverse grading, normal grading with clasts, and water-escape structures. As a counterpart to turbidite-dominated fan models suited for basinal settings, a slope model is proposed that is a debris-flow dominated setting with both non-channelized and channelized systems. Contrary to popular belief, deposits of sandy debris flows can be thick, areally extensive, clean (i.e., mud poor), and excellent reservoirs. High-frequency flows tend to develop amalgamated debris-flow deposits with lateral connectivity and sheet-like geometry. Submarine-fan models with turbidite channels and lobes have controlled our thinking for nearly 35 years, but I consider that these models are obsolete. The suprafan lobe concept was influential in both sedimentologic and sequence-stratigraphic circles because it provided a basis for constructing a general fan model and for linking mounded seismic facies with sheet-like turbidite sandstones. However, this concept recently was abandoned by its proponent, which has left the popular sequence-stratigraphic fan models with a shaky foundation. A paradigm shift is in order in the 21st century. This shift should involve the realization that thick deep-water massive sands are deposits of debris flows, not high-density turbidites. However, there are no standard vertical facies models that can be applied universally for either turbidites, contourites, or sandy debris flows. Science is a journey, whereas facies models terminate that journey and become the final destination.},

A model depicting a turbidite-to-contourite continuum of stratal types is applied to these three rock units. Recognition of a diverse suite of bedforms, coupled with analysis of paleocurrents, helps to better interpret depositional origin and basin paleogeography. The St. Croix strata record emplacement by gravity flows and, subsequently, by bottom currents flowing parallel to the base of slope; these sediments accumulated on a lower slope apron. A Niesenflysch section in the Swiss Alps west of Adelboden includes turbidites which were deposited at fairly regular intervals beyond the base of slope, in a setting more distal than that of the St. Croix sequences. Most of these turbidites appear to have been partially reworked by bottom currents related to basin circulation or to density flows from the basin margins. In the Annot Sandstone, reworked turbidites (termed transitional variants) and packets of entirely rippled strata are observed in submarine fan and slope sequences in the Peira-Cava area. In contrast to those in St. Croix and the Niesenflysch, the current-emplaced deposits of the Annot Sandstone are directly associated with fan-valley deposits. Such rippled strata in channels are deposits of gravity flow origin which were subsequently reworked downslope by currents generated by successive gravity flows; they also occur on levees by overbank flow. Consideration of multiple process transport is of special help to interpret sections which are poorly exposed, or which can be examined in cores, or which are located in sequences that have been highly deformed structurally.},

abstract = {Grain-size breaks are surfaces where abrupt changes in grain size occur vertically within deposits. Grain-size breaks are common features in turbidites around the world, including ancient and modern systems. Despite their widespread occurrence, grain-size breaks have been regarded as exceptional, and not included within idealized models of turbidity current deposition. This study uses ca 100 shallow sediment cores, from the Moroccan Turbidite System, to map out five turbidite beds for distances in excess of 2000 km. The vertical and spatial distributions of grain-size breaks within these beds are examined. Five different types of grain-size break are found: Type I – in proximal areas between coarse sand and finer grained structureless sand; Type II – in proximal areas between inversely graded sand overlain by finer sand; Type III – in proximal areas between sand overlain by ripple cross-laminated finer sand; Type IV – throughout the system between clean sand and mud; and Type V – in distal areas between mud-rich (debrite) sand and mud. This article interprets Types I and V as being generated by sharp vertical concentration boundaries, controlled by sediment and clay concentrations within the flows, whilst Types II and III are interpreted as products of spatial/temporal fluctuations in flow capacity. Type IV are interpreted as the product of fluid mud layers, which hinder the settling of non-cohesive grains and bypasses them down slope. Decelerating suspensions with sufficient clay will always form cohesive layers near to bed, promoting the generation of Type IV grain-size breaks. This may explain why Type IV grain-size breaks are widespread in all five turbidites examined and are commonplace within turbidite sequences studied elsewhere. Therefore, Type IV grain-size breaks should be understood as the norm, not the exception, and regarded as a typical feature within turbidite beds.},

abstract = {Review of the criteria which have been proposed for distinguishing between the deposits of turbidity currents and bottom currents in deep water sedimentation shows no general agreement on their validity. It is important to compare finegrained turbidites and contourites, to recognize that different turbidity current and bottom current mechanisms exist, and that their deposits may be closely inter-bedded in a continental rise environment. Interbedded turbidites and contourites have been recognized in cores from the deep-water margin off Nova Scotia. The most useful criteria for distinguishing between the two deposits were found to be: (1) fining and sorting trends: perpendicular or parallel to the contours; (2) marked textural differences between interbedded turbidites and contourites indicating differences in source and transport distance; (3) mineralogy and textural composition: regional patterns indicating transport perpendicular or parallel to the contours; (4) grain fabric: indication of downslope or along-slope transport at the time of final deposition; (5) sedimentary structures: turbidites show a structural sequence and evidence of rapid burial; contourites are bioturbated and contain irregular lag concentrations of biogenic sand. Other criteria include grain-size parameters, and the regional setting, distribution and depositional rate of the various facies. With due care these criteria can be applied to other regions. Previously used characteristics of silt-laminae abundance, layer thickness, heavy mineral cross lamination, sorting, and the nature of bed contacts are not applicable to fine-grained turbidites and contourites.

abstract = {Turbidite muds in cores from the outer Scotian continental margin, off eastern Canada, contain abundant thin silt laminae. Graded laminated units are recognized in parts of this sequence. These represent single depositional events, and show a regular decrease in modal grain size and thickness of the silt laminae through the unit. A similar fining trend is shown by both silt and mud layers over hundreds of kilometres downslope. Textural analysis of individual laminae allows the construction of a dynamically consistent physical model for transport and sorting in muddy turbidity currents. Hydraulic sorting aggregates finer material to the top and tail regions of a large turbidity flow which then overspills its channel banks. Downslope lateral sorting occurs with preferential deposition of coarser silt grains and larger mud flocs. Depositional sorting by increased shear in the boundary layer separates clay flocs from silt grains and results in a regular mud/silt lamination. Estimates can be made of the physical parameters of the turbidity flows involved. They are a minimum of several hundreds of metres thick, have low concentrations (of the order of 10−3 or 2500 mg 1−1), and move downslope at velocities of 10-20 cm s−1. A 5 mm thick, coarse silt lamina takes about 10 h to deposit, and the subsequent mud layer ‘blankets' very rapidly over this. A complete unit is deposited in 2-6 days which is the time it takes for the turbidity flow to pass a particular point. These thick, dilute, low-velocity flows are significantly different from the ‘classical' turbidity current. However, there is mounting evidence in support of the new concept from laboratory observations and direct field measurements.},

abstract = {This paper provides both an introduction to and summary for the Atlas of Contourite Systems that has been compiled as part of the International Geological Correlation Project - IGCP 432. Following the seminal works of George Wust on the physical oceanography of bottom currents, and Charley Hollister on contourite sediments, a series of significant advances have been made over the past few decades. While accepting that ideas and terms must remain flexible as our knowledge base continues to increase, we present a consensus view on terminology and definitions of bottom currents, contourites and drifts. Both thermohaline and wind-driven circulation, influenced by Coriolis Force and molded by topography, contribute to the oceanic system of bottom currents. These semi-permanent currents show significant variability in time and space, marked by periodic benthic storm events in areas of high surface kinetic energy. Six different drift types are recognized in the ocean basins and margins at depths greater than about 300 m: (i) contourite sheet drifts; (ii) elongate mounded drifts; (iii) channel related drifts; (iv) confined drifts; (v) infill drifts; and (vi) modified drift-turbidite systems. In addition to this overall geometry, their chief seismic characteristics include: a uniform reflector pattern that reflects long-term stability, drift-wide erosional discontinuities caused by periodic changes in bottom current regime, and stacked broadly lenticular seismic depositional units showing oblique to downcurrent migration. At a smaller scale, a variety of seismic facies can be recognized that are here related to bottom current intensity. A model for seismic facies cyclicity (alternating transparent/reflector zones) is further elaborated, and linked to bottom current/climate change. Both erosional features and depositional bedforms are diagnostic of bottom current systems and velocities. Many different contourite facies are now known to exist, encompassing all compositional types. We propose here a Cl-5 notation for the standard contourite facies sequence, which can be interpreted in terms of fluctuation in bottom current velocity and/or sediment supply. Several proxies can be utilized to decode contourite successions in terms of current fluctuation. Gravel lag and shale chip contourites, as well as erosional discontinuities are indicative of still greater velocities. There are a small but growing number of land-based examples of fossil contourites, based on careful analysis using the recommended three-stage approach to interpretation. Debate still surrounds the recognition and interpretation of bottom current reworked turbidites.},

abstract = {Despite three decades of study, there is still great controversy over the recognition and interpretation of fossil contourites exposed in ancient series on land. In order to best examine this problem, we briefly review the evidence from modern systems, including the many examples of Cenozoic contourites that have been recovered from DSDP/ODP drilling on major drifts in the present-day oceans. The range of contourite facies described from both deep-water ({\textgreater}2000 m) and mid-water (300–2000 m) drifts are mostly fine-grained, bioturbated and homogeneous, often with a distinct bedding cyclicity, and with some coarser-grained sandy contourites developed under higher-energy bottom currents. There are also a number of current-controlled sediment bodies that have formed in outer shelf/upper slope settings (50–300 m) under the influence of counter currents, underflows and major surface currents. These are not considered contourites sensu stricto, but may be mistaken as such in ancient examples. The most commonly described fossil contourites in the literature have been interpreted by the authors concerned as bottom-current reworked turbidites. However, a critical review suggests that these are the facies most subject to misinterpretation and many of the sediments claimed as fossil contourites are almost certainly fine-grained turbidites, whereas others were more likely formed under outer shelf/upper slope current systems. There remain very few ancient examples that are more closely comparable to modern contourites; these include the Cretaceous Talme Yafe Formation in Israel, the Ordovician Jiuxi Drift in China, and parts of the Paleogene Lefkara Formation, Cyprus and the Neogene Misaki Formation in Japan. We present a set of possible criteria for the recognition of fossil contourites and bottom-current reworked turbidites.},

abstract = {One of the principal scientific, technical and environmental challenges for the next century is undoubtedly the exploration and understanding of the deep oceans. Close collaboration between the hydrocarbon industry and scientific community is allowing us to push back this frontier and so to develop new models for deep-water sedimentary systems. The turbidity current paradigm is under scrutiny and refinements proposed for massive sands, megabeds and immature turbidites. Source area and sediment type are key controls. Bottom currents play an important part in the shaping of margins, the generation of hiatuses and bounding surfaces, the winnowing of sands and ventilation of ocean basins. It is at the level of architectural elements and their three-dimensional geometry that much activity is currently focused. Most advance has so far been made in terms of channel types, dimensions, aspect ratios, stacking patterns and hierarchies; to a lesser extent this is true for lobes, levee complexes, contourite drifts and sheet sands. It is only after this phase of study that we will be able to significantly improve our models for the larger-scale systems—fans, ramps, slope-aprons, basin plains and drifts.},

abstract = {A comparative study of the sequence of sedimentary structures in ancient and modern fine-grained turbidites is made in three contrasting areas. They are (1) Holocene and Pleistocene deep-sea muds of the Nova Scotian Slope and Rise, (2) Middle Ordovician Sevier Shale of the Valley and Ridge Province of the Southern Appalachians, and (3) Cambro-Ordovician Halifax Slate of the Meguma Group in Nova Scotia. A standard sequence of structures is proposed for fine-grained turbidites. The complete sequence has nine sub-divisions that are here termed T0 to T8. “The lower subdivision (T0) comprises a silt lamina which has a sharp, scoured and load-cast base, internal parallel-lamination and cross-lamination, and a sharp current-lineated or wavy surface with ‘fading-ripples' (= Type C etc. {\ldots}).” (= Type C ripple-drift cross-lamination, Jopling and Walker, 1968). The overlying sequence shows textural and compositional grading through alternating silt and mud laminae. A convolute-laminated sub-division (T1) is overlain by low-amplitude climbing ripples (T2), thin regular laminae (T3), thin indistinct laminae (T4), and thin wipsy or convolute laminae (T5). The topmost three divisions, graded mud (T6), ungraded mud (T7) and bioturbated mud (T8), do not have silt laminae but rare patchy silt lenses and silt pseudonodules and a thin zone of micro-burrowing near the upper surface. The proposed sequence is analogous to the Bouma (1962) structural scheme for sandy turbidites and is approximately equivalent to Bouma's (C)DE divisions. The repetition of partial sequences characterizes different parts of the slope/base-of-slope/basin plain environment, and represents deposition from different stages of evolution of a large, muddy, turbidity flow. Microstructural detail and sequence are well preserved in ancient and even slightly metamorphosed sediments. Their recognition is important for determining depositional processes and for palaeoenvironmental interpretation.},

abstract = {Mineralogic provinces are compositionally distinctive three-dimensional bodies of rock constituting natural units in terms of age, origin and distribution. More than one province likely will be present within the same sedimentary basin. Unconformities and not necessarily group, formation or member boundaries are the sharpest stratigraphic boundaries of provinces. Lateral boundaries are frequently gradational; depending on the scale of the basin analysis these areas of gradation can be separately defined as hybrid provinces. Over-generalization and over-simplification of interpretation of mineralogic provinces has resulted from inadequate appreciation and evaluation of the relative influence of the four principal factors controlling composition of a province: provenance, transportation, depositional environment and diagenesis. Each of these factors is in turn a dependent variable. A total of 13 immediate processes controlling province composition are identified. Improved ability to interpret ancient mineralogic provinces will develop from i) better documentation of starting or parent detritus, ii) quantitative estimation of the effects of transportation and environment on sediment composition through study of Holocene sediment, iii) more precise characterization of mineralogic provinces and iv) refinement of current techniques used in interpreting the origin of detrital quartz, feldspar, and accessory minerals.},

abstract = {Holocene fluvial sands derived from the same type of crystalline parent rocks in humid-temperate and arid/semi-arid climates have distinct compositions. For a particular climate and parent rock, the similarity in composition of the fluvial sands and the sand-size fraction of soils collected from the associated interfluves indicates that climatically controlled weathering of a specific parent rock type is a primary control of sand composition. Published estimates of the magnitude of destruction of lithic fragments and feldspars associated with stream transport and deposition in a beach/coastal dune environment permit the simulation of quantitative approximations of compositional maturation of sand. For transport distances of {\textless}75 km the simulated maturation does not significantly modify the distinctive climatic imprints on composition. However, simulated maturation due to deposition in beach/coastal dune environment effectively destroys the climatic imprint. Although marine processes are highly capable of mechanically destroying lithic fragments and feldspar, our study suggests that large-scale production of first-cycle quartz arenites in such an environment is not probable. Only a rare, unique combination of extreme conditions of climate (tropical), relief (low), and sedimentation rate (slow) can give rise to first-cycle quartz arenites. Therefore we conclude that the bulk of ancient quartz arenite is multicycle in origin.},

abstract = {It is well-known that sediment composition strongly depends on grain size. A number of studies have tried to quantify this relationship focusing on the sand fraction, but only very limited data exists covering wider grain size ranges. Geologists have a clear conceptual model of the relation between grain size and sediment petrograpic composition, typically displayed in evolution diagrams. We chose a classical model covering grain sizes from fine gravel to clay, and distinguishing five types of grains (rock fragments, poly- and mono crystalline quartz, feldspar and mica/clay). A compositional linear process is fitted here to a digitized version of this model, by (i) applying classical regression to the set of all pairwise log-ratios of the 5-part composition against grain size, and (ii) looking for the compositions that best approximate the set of estimated parameters, one acting as slope and one as intercept. The method is useful even in the presence of several missing values. The linear fit suggests that the relative influence of the processes controlling the relationship between grain size and sediment composition is constant along most of the grain size spectrum.},

abstract = {The influence of near-bed sorting processes on heavy mineral content in suspension is discussed. Sediment concentrations above a rippled bed of mixed quartz and heavy mineral sand were measured under regular nonbreaking waves in the laboratory. Using the traditional gradient diffusion process, settling velocity would be expected to strongly affect sediment distribution. This was not observed during present trials. In fact, the vertical gradients of time-averaged suspension concentrations were found to be similar for the light and heavy minerals, despite their different settling velocities. This behavior implies a convective rather than diffusive distribution mechanism. Between the nonmoving bed and the lowest suspension sampling point, light and heavy mineral concentration differs by two orders of magnitude. This discrimination against the heavy minerals in the pickup process is due largely to selective entrainment at the ripple face. Bedform dynamics and the nature of quartz suspension profiles are found to be little affected by the trialed proportion of overall heavy minerals in the bed (3.8-22.1{\%}).},

Heavy minerals decrease in abundance in the direction of transport, and the degree to which any particular mineral lags behind another lighter mineral is a simple function of the mineral's effective-density ratio.

abstract = {This paper deals with the general features of Mesozoic and Tertiary rock sequences and paleogeography in the Alps. It seeks to outline the paleotectonic significance of the rocks and to discuss the structural evolution of the Alpine geosyncline up to the main deformation, with special reference to the sector between the rivers Rhine and Durance. Accent is placed on the relative independence of Alpine structures involving the pre-Triassic basement rocks and of cover nappes consisting only of Mesozoic and Tertiary formations. Normal shallow-water deposits of platform or miogeosynclinal type were laid down over the whole area before eugeosynclinal conditions set in. The typical eugeosynclinal sediments in the central, Penninic belt of the Alps are the Schistes lustr{\'{e}}s and B{\"{u}}ndnerschiefer, with sills and submarine lava flows of basic volcanic rocks (ophiolites). Before metamorphism they consisted mainly of shales and of impure arenaceous and argillaceous limestones. The bathymetric environment of radiolarian cherts and associated rocks is examined, and their deep-water origin is upheld for the Alpine occurrences. Marine polygenic breccias are characteristic of geosynclinal slopes (commonly fault scarps) and not of a particular depth zone. The Alpine Flysch is a particularly significant sediment. Flysch is a thick marine deposit of predominantly detrital rocks, in part turbidites, generally without volcanic rocks, and laid down during compressional deformation of the geosyncline. Of the many different kinds of Flysch some represent transitions to either B{\"{u}}ndnerschiefer or Molasse. Essential differences between the early synorogenic Flysch and the later synorogenic to post-orogenic Molasse are listed. Argand's stimulating embryotectonic theory of the evolution of the geosyncline is outlined and rejected. The Triassic corresponds to a neutral interval, between the Hercynian and Alpine cycles. Early Alpine geosynclinal history was characterized by vertical or tensional movements along normal faults that limited narrow platforms and rapidly subsiding troughs. This tensional deformation weakened in the Late Jurassic, whereupon bottom relief diminished, and "para-oceanic" conditions prevailed over a large part of the Mediterranean realm. New linear welts of compressional origin arose during the Cretaceous and developed into steep island chains limiting the Flysch basins. Gradually the central part of the Alps rose above sea level, and the geosyncline migrated to the north and west. Here it was finally filled and gave way to the foreland trough in which the Molasse was laid down. There is no simple, direct, genetic and space relationship between Hercynian structures, fault-bordered platforms and troughs of the earlier geosynclinal phase, island chains and basins of the Flysch phase, and the later nappe structures. Paleogeographical features are commonly short-lived and migratory.},

abstract = {A stratigraphical and sedimentological study of the Gurnigel-Flysch of the external Prealps N of Montreux (Lake Geneva region. Switzerland) has been carried out. The study of calcareous nannoplancton and dinoflagellates shows that the age of this flysch ranges from Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) to Lower Eocene (Ilerdian). A new dinoflagellate association, the Deflandrea striata association, indicating the Lower Paleocene, is defined. Glauconite, dated radiometrically by K/Ar method, turns out to be rejuvenated. Depositional environment of the flysch of the Fayaux quarry is interpreted as fringe of a deep-sea fan below carbonate compensation depth. The clay mineral content has been determined. Comparisons with other parts of the Gurnigel-Flysch in the external Prealps. and with the ultrahel¬ vetic flysch of the internal Prealps (Zone des Cols) are made},

abstract = {Trends in compositional diagrams are frequently used to describe and interpret the imprint of certain processes on sediment composition. Most of these trends are intuitive and "hand-drawn", although a numerical description of compositional changes involved with these processes would allow for a quantitative assessment of the observed sediment compositions and the proposed processes. This paper suggests a statistical approach to model compositional linear trends, which allows for a mathematically rigorous description of changes in sediment composition related to a specific process or a combination of processes. Three case studies dealing with different aspects of the sedimentary cycle demonstrate the usefulness of the approach. In the first example, a modelled average global chemical weathering trend is used to calculate an appropriate measure for the degree of chemical weathering of the suspended load from some of the world's major rivers. In the second example, data on precipitation and relief from different watersheds are quantitatively related to the petrographic composition of fine-grained sands from low-order streams derived from these watersheds. The third example is an attempt to quantify the interdependence of chemical sediment composition and grain size in the absence of chemical weathering. Superposition of individual compositional linear trends allows for modelling sediment composition in more complicated case studies. Although primarily a forward modelling approach, it can be also used inversely, and, therefore, has strong potential for tracing back the sediment-forming processes in order to reconstruct the original source rocks of the sediment. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Detrital modes are the basic type of quantitative data used in sedimentary petrology. They represent estimates of the petrographic framework composition of sand or sandstone obtained by point counting of thin sections. At present, geological inferences from analysis of these numerical data are semi-quantitative only, because many of the data-processing methods employed in sedimentary petrology lack a firm theoretical basis. A review of existing methods reveals a number of fundamental statistical problems associated with the use of univariate statistics and the construction of so-called hexagonal fields of compositional variation. It is shown that these problems can be overcome by using multivariate methods that honour the non-negativity and unit-sum constraints on compositional data, and incorporate the covariance structure. Spread in compositional data can be modelled on two levels: (1) by regarding the grain as unit of observation, and the total point count as a sample from a multinomial distribution; (2) by regarding the total count as unit of observation, and a set of counts as a sample from an additive logistic normal distribution. Numerical methods are presented for constructing statistically rigorous confidence regions in ternary diagrams by inversion of significance tests for these two distributions. Statistical analyses of the framework composition and heavy-mineral assemblages of modern beach and river sands illustrate their use. The case histories are followed by a brief overview of popular multivariate methods for reconstructing sediment provenance.},

abstract = {One of the outstanding problems of palaeoclimate reconstruction from physico-chemical properties of terrigenous deep-sea sediments stems from the fact that most basin fills are mixtures of sediment populations derived from different sources and transported to the site of deposition by different mechanisms. Conventional approaches to palaeoclimate reconstruction from deep-sea sediments do not distinguish between provenance and dispersal-related variations, and therefore often fail to recognise the true significance of variations in sediment properties. We formulate a set of requirements that each proposed palaeo-environmental indicator should fulfil, and focus on the intrinsic coupling between grain size and chemical composition. A critical review of past achievements in grain-size analysis serves to introduce a conceptual model of spatio-temporal grain-size variation based on dynamic populations. Each dynamic population results from a characteristic combination of production and transport mechanisms that corresponds to a distinct subpopulation in the data analysed. The mathematical-statistical representation of the conceptual model can be obtained by means of the end-member-modelling algorithm EMMA. Applications of the model to several ocean basins are discussed, as well as methods to examine the validity of grain-size-based palaeoclimate reconstructions. Palaeoclimate reconstructions of a high- and low-latitude basin illustrate the common degree of complexity of deep-sea grain-size records. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Late Maastrichtian to Middle Eocene Gurnigel-Schlieren Flysch is analysed from the point of view of tectonic control on deposition. Facies show an alternation of abyssal plain/oceanic slope, trench fill channellized and non-channellized sediments and finally lower slope deposits. The facies evolution points to a sporadically active subduction trench environment. A detailed picture of the sediment dispersal pattern is deduced from framework-grain analysis, feldspar and lithic fragment counts and conglomerate analysis on current oriented samples. This picture includes 10 major and 3 minor depositional systems which varied in time and space. Variation was influenced by tectonic movements in the basin and source areas, and by sea-level changes. Smoothing out of late Alpine deformation reveals a west-east trending elongated basin geometry and sediment distribution pattern. Flow directions which do not fit with the model are discussed: the Eocene subduction-related rotation of parts of the basin is suggested to have disrupted an initially coherent flow pattern. The sequence was deposited within a remnant of the South Penninic Ligurian ocean, in a trench environment bordered by a continental margin arc.},

abstract = {We examine the structures of the biggest and best exposed unit of the Prealpine nappe stack, the Klippen nappe in the eastern Pr{\'{e}}alpes Romandes. During the Alpine orogeny, the Klippen nappe was incorporated into the accretionary wedge of the closing Pi{\'{e}}mont ocean, detached from the basement along a basal evaporite horizon and transported onto the foreland in a thin-skinned tectonic style. The stratigraphy of this cover nappe changes significantly parallel and perpendicular to strike. These variations give rise to changes in structural style of the cover nappe, from mainly fold structures in the north to large imbricates in the south. Results from our field study, previous work and seismic data permit the subdivision of the cover sequence into 5 sectors from north to south, which arc-separated by thrust faults. This subdivision is the basis for the reconstruction of the Klippen nappe paleobasin. This basin is crosscut by a number of synsedimentary paleofaults. Our model of emplacement and internal deformation of the Klippen nappe suggests that ramping and stacking of imbricates in the southern part of the nappe is controlled by the low thickness and insufficient continuity of the evaporite layers below the massive carbonate units. The fault-related fold structures in the northern part seem to be influenced by the larger thickness of these evaporites and the presence of heterogeneities which resulted from synsedimentary faults within the interlayered carbonate sequences.},

abstract = {This study investigated the correlation of the size of detrital zircons with their age populations in a fluvial environment. From 31 floodplain sediments that were isolated from the mainstream and ten major tributaries of the Changjiang River, 3526 detrital zircon grains were selected for size examination, and 1358 were chosen for U-Pb age measurements. The Equivalent Spherical Diameter (ESD) of most zircon grains falls within the range of 32-250$\mu$m, and the dominant size is 63-125$\mu$m. Small-sized zircons with ESDs of {\textless} 63$\mu$m are found in higher proportions in the mid-lower mainstream than in the upper reaches. An overall decrease in the average ESD size of detrital zircons towards the mid-lower reaches reflects the hydraulic sorting effect of different river flow regimes along this river. Overall, the age populations of zircons between the different tributaries and mainstream are similar, and several age groups correspond well with major tectonic-magmatic events that happened in the river basin. This study confirms the notion that younger zircons have coarser and more variable sizes than the older zircons, indicating the potential influence of hydrodynamic fractionation on zircon size and ages. The problem of grain-size bias on age-data acquisition and interpretation of detrital zircons from large rivers is not negligible and deserves more attention when using zircon geochronology to decipher sediment provenance and tectonic evolution. Although the zircons with an ESD of 63-125$\mu$m dominate the Changjiang sediment and have similar age populations as the bulk zircons, whether this narrow-sized window can accurately represent the bulk zircon geochronology of the weathered and heterogeneous rocks in the large catchment awaits additional investigations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The discovery of turbidites represents perhaps the major genuine advance of sedimentology during the twentieth century. Turbidites are the deposits of turbidity currents andwere originally related to the gravitational instabil- ity and re-sedimentation of previously accumulated shallow water sediments into deep waters. As these flows originate and entirely evolve within a marine or lacustrine basin, their associated deposits are here termed intrabasinal turbidites. Controversially, increasing evidences support that turbidity currents can also be originated by the direct discharge of sediment–water mixtures by rivers in flood (hyperpycnal flows). Since these flows are originated in the continent, their associated deposits are here termed extrabasinal turbidites. Deposits related to these two different turbidity currents are often confused in the literature although they display diagnostic features that allowa clear differentiation between them. Intrabasinal turbidites are mostly related to surge-like (unsteady) flows that initiate from a cohesive debris flow that accelerates along the slope and evolves into a granular and finally a turbulent flow. Its flow behavior results on the accumulation of normally graded beds and bedsets that lacks terrestrial phytodetritus and lofting rhythmites. Extrabasinal turbidites, on the contrary, are deposits related to fully turbulent flows having interstitial freshwater and sustained by a relatively dense and long-lived river discharge. According to the grain size of suspended materials, hyperpycnal flows can be muddy or sandy. Sandy hyperpycnal flows (with or without associated bedload) often accumulate sandy to gravelly composite beds in prodelta to inner basin areas. Their typical deposits show sharp to gradual internal facies changes and recurrence, with abundant plant remains. In marine waters, the density reversal induced by freshwater results in the accumulation of lofting rhythmites at flow margin areas. Muddy hyperpycnal flows are loaded by a turbulent suspension dominantly composed of a mixture of silt and clay-sized particles (b62.5 $\mu$m) of varying compositions. Since the suspended sediment concentration does not substantially decrease in waning flows, muddy hyperpycnal flows will be not affected by lofting, and the flow will remain attached to the sea bottomuntil its final accumulation. Typical deposits compose cm to dm-thick graded shale beds disposed over an erosive base with displaced marine microfossils and dispersed plant remains. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {Integration of basin analysis with arenite petro- graphy provides a powerful tool in obtaining palaeo- geographic reconstructions. However, several factors need to be considered if ancient geological settings are to be correctly interpreted. The following concepts are outlined: 1. A classification of the main types of grains in arenite frameworks according to temporal (coeval versus non-coeval), spatial (intrabasinal versus extra basinal) and compositional criteria. 2. A calibrated procedure for detecting coeval versus non-coeval carbonate grains. This technique is applied, and the palaeogeographic implications are illustrated, in a case study: the Paleogene arenites of the Ager valley, Pyrenees. 3. A classification scheme for volcanic grains, involving five classes dependent on palaeovolcanic and neovolcanic sources. A case history, volcanic Quaternary sands deposited in the Nankai Trough off south-western Japan, illustrates the application of the scheme. 4. Compositional and textural criteria which manifest the presence of multicycle as opposed to first-cycle components in the siliciclastic sand frame- work. The proposed criteria area applied in a case history: modern sands carried by rivers to the North- ern Adriatic Sea 5. The effect of grain size on detrital mode data obtained by optical analyses. A slight modification of the Dickinson point-counting method (1970) as orig- inally proposed by Gazzi (1966) enables loss of infor- mation to be avoided and the dependence of composition on grain size to be minimized. 6. Factors which complicate the connection between source area and depositional basin in palaeogeographic reconstructions. Examples are pre- sented for the influence of sea-level variations, littoral drift currents, dominant winds, continental glaci- ations, cannibalism and tectonic setting.},

@article{Zuffa1991,
abstract = {When we determine framework petrography of deep-sea arenites for provenance studies we should concentrate not only on what particles make up sedimentary beds but also when, where and how they form. Taking such information into account, grains can be classified according to their temporal, spatial and compositional characteristics. This will allow a better understanding of palaeogeography and palaeotectonics of the basin/source system. Two examples from the literature that support this approach are reported.},
